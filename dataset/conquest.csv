  ",4,"Super easy as all modern Fire Emblem games have been. Not an issue but worth noting. The story was painfully boring. I didn't really care much about any of the characters except Corrin and Azula. Some of the maps were fun, others not so much. Wish they did without the incest. I get that romance is heavily emphasized in the 3ds game but letting Corrin marry and have kids with their supposed blood relatives is weird and the primary reason for the low rating. I don't care if they aren't technically related because that's worse as it ruins the whole point of the story. Where's the tension if Corrin isn't actually related to either side? It's just a war between two groups. The only part of this game worth playing is Corrin in Smash"

  ",4,"The fate series had 3 games it all put out at once, and while I think they are all of similar quality; Conquest is the best of them. The same issues are present in this version as it's counterparts, 2 chapters at the end are connected, but don't give you a save between them, the game is largely designed on casual play over traditional, the marriage/child mechanic is forced and heavily encouraged, and Corrin is still as personable as dry wall.While this game is treated as the hardest of the 3, in reality it's actually far more fair and reasonable. A lot of the hardness in the game really just comes from being unprepared or not getting proper levels for certain units, and while most games this would be bad design, in Fire Emblem, it's par the course. In fact, a lot of conquest actually feels like it was designed with far more thought and reason beyond. Conquest's story actually presents proper moral dilemmas and doesn't end things as tightly as it's counterparts because that's what war is.Conquest still has some awful moments, most notably chapter 11, and Nohr's family issues with their father, but it largely feels like they were heading to fix the issues till Nintendo ordered more games in Fate. In a lot of ways, you can see what Fate was suppose to be in conquest, but overall this is just a mediocre experience with some interesting bits."

  ",9,"Probably one of my favorite games. Highly recommend if you like turn-based strategy games. If you care a lot about story though, this game may not be for you.

Pros:
-Challenging, largely fair gameplay that mostly avoids giving unique advantages to the enemy
-Dragon veins give a lot of variety to approaching a chapter
-Lunatic mode isn't just stat inflation and slapping a couple OP skills; groups of enemies change as does how they behave
-One route has enough content to make a satisfying game on its own
-Rework of the pair-up system is welcome and largely well done
-Personal skills are a great touch to make even the worst units viable
-Classes are no longer gender-locked; opening up options for reclassing units without being so open that you can spec every unit into one overpowered class
-Method of gaining access to classes is complex and appropriately restricted behind how you play with a unit in battle
-UI is excellent and takes full advantage of dual screens
-CG cutscenes look quite amazing given the hardware running it
-Music is pretty good
-Enemy capture system is fun to play with and offers alternatives if a unit falls too far behind
-Large variety in victory conditions
-Many maps are designed to discourage turtling and low-manning; much appreciated considering these strategies are a common cheese in FE
-The process behind building a good child unit is actually pretty involved and adds replay value

Cons:
-Nonsensical plot
-Plot-wise, child units felt tacked on
-Mostly one-note characters
-There is one unique enemy advantage that cheapens the final chapters on Lunatic a little bit since it allows debuffs to stack
-Extremely poor localization that cuts content
-Extra routes cost money
-Weapon system makes many weapon types undesireable even though they're traditionally better
-Defense stance is a little too broken compared to attack stance"

El juego es ridiculamente dificil en varios niveles, creo que ese es el punto mas negativo y por lo que no merece un 10. Es absurdo que no permitan entrenar a las unidades. SI te equivocas, como todo el mundo que jugo por primera vez, vas a batallar aun mas en superar los niveles y conseguir los matrimonios que merecen la pena ver. El soundtrack es bellisimo, mejor que Ocarina of Time. Un ultimo punto negativo, y por lo que no merece un 9.5, es el sistema de clases, realmente no hay forma de darse cuenta que tan importante es elegir la clase y las caracteristicas de los personajes al usar ciertas armas, por lo que uno se encuentra ""a ciegas"" a la hora de decidir como equipar a las unidades."

The story had giant plots which literally in the story said dont worry about it. The big problem with conquest is that it has a better story than birthright but the gameplay is like a glove that doesnt fit. This game is literally the reason phoenix mode exists.

I found the story to be meh and gameplays biggest problem is that its not balanced properly and unlike birthright it overstays its welcome because of its balance issues"

Everybody knows by now that the story is a mess, but I'd go as so far as to say that's the only bad thing about the game proper. Everything else, I'd say, is superb; the graphics are gorgeous, the characters are lovable, the gameplay is - hands down - the best in the franchise, and I even enjoyed bits and pieces of Fates' extremely flawed narrative.

If you want to pick up this game, I recommend you do so gauging it by its own merits and not paying the story too much heed. Even if it's not a good FE game (which I disagree with, but understand the mentality), it's still a good game overall that I strongly recommend."

Seriously?). The main character was a self-insert mary sue who in Conquest, was treated like a doormat to justify anything that happened. Most importantly, Fates failed to capture anything that made FE, FE. I am a long time FE fan and I can honestly say that this is NOT Fire Emblem. None of this is what Fire Emblem is about.

The music if not amazing is really good and as any FE game it has a ton of characters that are interesting for the most part, the game play is brutal and you can't grind so you better choose a balanced team and stick with them till the end or be like me and use everyone and suffer from that. The thing is that the story and that was my only issue also with FE Awakening, at least for me doesn't match the heights of the game play or the characters it has, it feels so generic that you see everything coming from miles away, also the English dub is not that bad because there are a lot of lines but is kinda annoying and you can't switch it to Japanese. In the end Conquest offers a pretty solid game play and solid experience that puts you in the shoes of an strategist, if only the story was at least a little more original and interesting this game could be a masterpiece."

This game is amazing! In fact, I'd even say that it became one of my new favorite video-games of all-time. The story follows your avatar ( Corrin ) who was raised in the kingdom of Nohr, ruled by King Garon. After a while, you run into the Hoshidans, who claim to be your birth family. It's up to you to make the ultimate choice, fight with your birth family, or side with the Nohrians who have raised and loved you for years. This game has a decent storyline that is very heart-felt. The game is one of the few games to actually pull at my heartstrings and make me tear up. The gameplay is great, it's easy to get the hang of and it is very addictive. Unlike the missions in "" Birthright "" ( rout the enemy or defeat the boss ) the missions in this one are very unique and they don't make the game feel repetitive ( defend the area, escape with all units, defeat all bosses in 20 turns, etc. ). The soundtrack is flawless ! It fits the tone of the game perfectly and they are very pleasing to listen to ( "" Lost in thoughts all alone "" is one of the best songs I've heard in a game. ). So overall, this game is a masterpiece. I can't think of one thing I had a problem with ( despite some plot-points I won't spoil. ). This game is smart, well-crafted, emotional, and highly addictive. One of the few times I would call a game perfect. 10/10"

  ",6,"A good challenge and fun to play as a strategy game. However, the setting, plot and characters leave much to be desired.

+Maps now have diverse objectives and are generally well-designed. Reinforcements appear at sensible moments & locations and do not have the potential to completely screw you over like they did in FE: Awakening.
+The class system still needs a guide to make sense of, but it does allow for more varied characters over different playthroughs.
+There is a good range of difficulty and I found myself playing different styles throughout the chapters.
+Some of the character support conversations are genuinely cute and pleasant

-The setting of fighting for the seemingly darker empire that is Nohr is a good start. Unfortunately it becomes clear that only the King and his henchmen are evil and that all of your royal sibling are lovable goody-two-shoes, which is a lame cliche and results in no real character development (as nothing changes).
-The chapters adopt a predictable pattern of ""go defeat X for your evil king and complain about it"", which grows really tired after the 10th time.
-Not much is explained about the world. Entire nations pop into existence when the plot demands it and vanish into obscurity right after the respective mission is done. The world doesn't feel very alive as a result.

Overall the game is fun to play, but the story segments are so weak that I just stopped reading them around half-way through."

  ",9,"Conquest is a must have for those Fire Emblem fans who want to prove that they are more than just casual fans of the series and up for a fun challenge. Some maps (for inexperienced players) can be notoriously challenging. But with that comes the satisfaction in micromanaging each units move during the mission and finally finishing it after a myriad attempts. If you find yourself easily frustrated and have little experience playing Fire Emblem games, I really recommend Birthright, or if you insist you want to side with Nohr: to only play on Normal+Casual mode on Conquest.

Fire Emblem Fates is an excellent follow up to Awakening on the 3DS. It boasts a *very* powerful soundtrack, eye-candy cut scenes and a polished battle system. The small loss in quality that some people accuse it of having in terms of plot/dialogue it makes up in the quantity of having Conquest, Revelations and Birthright. It does suffer from serious localisation issues, resulting in some very obsolete and pointless game features (ex: private quarters/character bonding outside support dialogues).
The castle system introduced in this game is not perfect but is extremely enjoyable for those who want to customise their team to the max, and although its been abused, offers some interesting aspects to the game.

As a side note - Please ignore anyone complaining about localisation. Yes, a few features were lost but boo hoo we aren't playing fire emblem so we can pet/marry our favourite characters, that's a completely different genre people. Please appreciate the wonderful game we have been granted by our friends at Nintendo."

The story is fun, dark, and has some full emotion moments, but some of the interactions between the characters are really not good.

  ",7,"Fire Emblem Fates:  Conquest boasts to being a tribute to classic Fire Emblem games with no level grinding, more difficult and dynamic gameplay.

To begin with, the story is horribly written and portrayed for Fire Emblem games.  The villain of the game is already revealed to you before you make your decision on whether to defend Hoshido or Nohr, which makes choosing to be on Nohr's side in this case to be meaningless.  The villain can be dumbed down to ""rah rah evil!"" and doesn't leave as much of an impact as the previous games, usually with a king from a different nation threatening dominance onto other nations.  Not to mention that a lot of deus ex machina conflicts regarding the main protagonist ruins the overall immersion of the game.  I can also conclude that it's one of the worst written games in the franchise, which is sad considering how much time and effort was spent into making the script for the game.  However, the game presents really well in my opinion.  It has a great soundtrack and its art-style is terrific.  The character designs aren't half bad either, and I didn't have an issue with how the game looks overall.

Although it may have sounded like I was praising the gameplay before, it's very wishy-washy.  The gameplay isn't bad, but Fire Emblem veterans are going to have issues adjusting to this style of game.  To begin with, pairing up is still a mechanic, but is more balanced, as the enemies can pair up as well.  Pairing up was broken in Fire Emblem Awakening, so it makes me glad to say this.  However, the game has decided to put more emphasis on character interactions than strategic gameplay, which I think was a horrible mistake.  In previous Fire Emblem games, the support system was always a minor side gameplay element meant to elevate the characters, their personalities, and the story as a whole.  I don't have a problem with this, as if you do your research and match certain characters correctly with others, you can have amazingly strong child units.  Though, here's the kicker:  Unlike Fire Emblem Awakening, children units hold no purpose to the overall plot of Fire Emblem Fates.  It serves no purpose and is just a means to pair with units and to get overly stronger units with better skills.  If that's what you want to do with your Fire Emblem game, then that's fine, but I think it's an overly forced mechanic without significance.

Regarding weapons, I have both a good and a bad thing to say about it.  The good thing is that weapons are color coded, making the weapon triangle more diverse and allowing for more strategy.  However, none of the weapons in this game, with the exception of staves, can break.  It makes a lot of the special unbreakable insignificant in comparison and breaks a lot of the immersion in general.  One thing that I hear a lot is that this is the harder version of the Fates collection, and although it is difficult, with a bit of trial and error, you can definitely make it past on normal mode without too much difficulty.  The map design is also quite varied, allowing for a lot of interesting chapters.

Overall, Fire Emblem Conquest is a good game, but it doesn't quite reach the potential of what's considered to be a good Fire Emblem game.  If you want to get into the Fire Emblem series, then you should probably get into Blazing Sword or Sacred Stones, as both games are cheaper to get on the 3DS eShop, and provide a much better first time experience.  If you're a Fire Emblem veteran and (somehow) haven't played Fates to this point, then know that this isn't reaching the quality of the GBA and Tellius games."

  ",9,"You'll notice the negative reviews due to censorship- while I disagree with the concept of censorship, I'm glad  they did it in this case. The scenes that you spend with your spouse are awkward enough as it is- I'm glad that they removed the minigame that was in the Japanese version. It would have been terribly cringe-worthy. I know next to nothing about the missing dialogue (and I can vouch for the fact that the voice acting is absolutely minimalist), but the writing that is present in the game is on par with that from Awakening- no better, no less.

With that said, the actual game is one of the most exciting things to happen to Fire Emblem since I've been a fan. The game retains its strong strategic/RPG roots, but it also mixes up its strategic balance to make things seem fresh. You no longer have weapon durability, but now you have to determine which weapon is best for each situation. You now auto-attack with neighboring units, unless you decide to pair up with another unit to increase your stats. Do you want damage, or survivability? I love the inclusion of shurikens/throwing knives, which are designed to weaken your opponents. Soften them up with a ninja attack and then finish them off with a coordinated follow-up. These kinds of strategies mix up everything that I implemented in Awakening. I loved how this game was also very challenging- I started off on Hard, and about 2/3 the way through I had to tone down the difficulty. That last bit of the game was very easy, but I'd had enough of a challenge by that point. The beautiful animated cutscenes return (although I will always wish they had more of these), but I felt like the fan-service given by Camilla was absolutely over-the-top and unnecessary. I have to be wary of playing this game around my wife."

  ",1,"The story is too basic, half of your allies are **** your Main Character chose to side with the bad guy kingdom instead of his family... the list goes on.

But worst of all: Conquest was supposed to be ""challenging."" And chapters 1-9 were just that: difficult, made hard enough to test you considerably, but not unreasonable. However, chapter 10 was a difficulty spike the likes of which I had never seen before. It went from ""difficult"" to ""psychopathically sadistic."" I picked ""hard"" difficulty, and 1-9 were just that: hard. But chapter 10 took it up to Lunatic-difficulty levels. I have played the entire Advanced Wars series, and 3 fire emblem games before this one, and I expect better than this difficulty-spike BS from Intelligent Systems. 1/10 because I feel betrayed as a player, as a customer, and as a fan of the series."

  ",9,"A great game, I have sunk so many hours into this that I can't even complain that it made me buy the optional alternate paths and DLC as even including those into the cost, it has still been great value.  I prefer the characters in this to Birthright and there was more variety in the missions making this the better game but I would recommend playing Birthright first as inevitably you'll want to see the story from that side and it serves as a good warm up.
Conquest is hard, even on it's lowest difficulty. I have no idea how people defeat it in hardcore mode."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest is a worthy followup to the critically acclaimed Fire Emblem Awakening. It needs to be said however that Conquest is designed to be more difficult. If you want a challenge? Conquest will test even the most seasoned FE fans.

It needs to be said that FE:Fate's presentation is top notch. The cutscenes and character animations are well done. The character models themselves actually have feet! In areas like my castle you can tap the L shoulder button to zoom down and see your surroundings in 3rd person. In battle the camera shifts from top down to also zoom in on your surrounding terrain.

Conquests' story can be best described as siding with your adopted family the Nohr empire. Birthright on the other hand has you siding with your blood relation of the Hoshido. But as any Fire Emblem vet can tell you; its a bit more nuanced than that. Birthright and Conquest essentially start the same. At mission 5 you will then branch off into that version's storyline. Birthright is the easier more accessible version. It allows you to grind and fight random battles to build up your party. Conquest on the other had requires careful thought and planning to succeed.

Fates introduces some new mechanics that shake up some classic Fire Emblem staples. Weapons no longer take durability damage (aside from staves and rods). The map can be altered using what are called Dragon veins. These spots can create bridges, level mountains and more.

The game also introduces a new area called My Castle. You can build buildings such as shops, mess hall, fishing pond and more. These often offer items that you can use in a number of ways. In my castle you can also invite party members to your private quarters to boost your relationship. The dating sim elements of Awakening have been expanded here in that once you marry you will have new options within your private quarters. You may also have to use the stylus to wake your significant other for instance.

My castle also has a little bit of online multiplayer in it that allows you to siege other player's castles and defend your own as well.

Its advisable to play Birthright first followed by Conquest and then Revelation. Buying physical copies of both is essentially a waste of money because you get the others at a cheaper price as a download once you own one version.

Overall Conquest is an excellent part in one of the most expansive Fire Emblem tales to date."

  ",9,"Both Fates games improved on or matched Awakening in the best ways possible. The gameplay was fun - I personally prefer the challenge Conquest provides, but all three routes were enjoyable by themselves. If you're new to the series, Birthright is probably better to wade into.

The story and characters are what really hit it home for me. I got so attached to many of them, and the story was great. I played through Conquest first, and when I played through Birthright, I felt so guilty for betraying the Nohrians.

There weren't quite as many choices as Nintendo was implying, but honestly, I didn't mind. I was too preoccupied by the game itself to notice until I was done playing."

  ",8,"The game is a fun tactical RPG with fun levels, great difficulty and a pretty good story. However, their are some negative things about the game as well, such as the limited levels. I know that Nintendo wanted to make the game hard by providing limited opportunities for exp, but the problem with that is that unlike Awakening, their are barley any paralogues beside Mozu's and the children. And besides Mozu's level, most of them have high level enemies, making it extremely hard to level up your low level characters. Also, a lot of things about the plot don't make sense unless you play Revelations and/or the DLC, like Azura vanishing at the end. But those little things, I believe, don't matter when the rest of the game is so good. The game isn't perfect, but still good enough to be one of my favorites."

  ",10,"This game is practically flawless. The gameplay is excellent, and provides a true challenge on hard/classic mode, as well as a no-grind experience. I couldn't care less about the ""censorship"" of this game, since I'm not that interested in supports, and the cut minigame feels like a weird waifu stuff, already all too present in the game anyway. But as I said, in my opinion the point of the game is the game itself, which is excellent and probably the best thing that could come to the late years of the 3DS, not the relationships between characters.
Overall, I'm truly grateful to Nintendo and to Intelligent Systems to have revived those series, even if on handheld, and I hope that we will get more of the same vein in the years to come."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem is definitely one of my top 5 franchises ever, and I think superior to XCOM as the best turn-based tactical strategy game, and with far better story and character development on top of better tactics. Conquest is the more difficult of the three and will demand your attention and caution, even on normal difficulty. It expands and improves on everything in Awakening and keeps all the good stuff, exactly what a sequel in a long-running game series should do. I really hope they make amiibo for the top 5-6 characters from the trilogy. I would buy them all!"
