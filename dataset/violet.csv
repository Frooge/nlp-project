  ",7,"Pokemon Violet es el nuevo juego de la saga principal que vuelve a intentar modificar la fórmula habitual. En esta ocasión el nuevo enfoque funciona y se convierte a nivel jugabilidad y libertad uno de los mejores juegos de la saga. El mantemer los gimnasios añadiendo otras rutas complementarias crea un mundo abierto muy entretenido. La historia me da la sensación que cada vez es más infantil, aunque la parte final mejora. Lo que no tiene perdón, es lo malo que es a nivel técnico. Mala optimización, bugs y sensación de lag continuo mientras juegas. Es la primera vez que me ha costado acostumbrarme jugar a un juego por su mal apartado técnico. Solo por este apartado merece una nota de cero. Si te gusta Pokemon, es una revolución que hacía falta a la saga, pero ve siendo consciente de que a nivel técnico es posible que hasta que te acostumbras te quite las ganas de jugar. Le pongo un 7 intentando valorar lo bueno, que es un 9, pero el 0 del apartado técnico me hace imposible pasarlo por alto."

  ",3,"I really love the pokemon franchise, but this literally hurts to play

- The open world seems empty and uninteresting 

- The game obviously has a lot of bugs, which makes it really annoying to play and it takes away nearly all the fun from running around in the world

- The game just closes itself a lot of times

- I don't really like the graphic and it also has a lot of errors (often the game looks like a really bad stopmotion video)

- even if the game is pretty old now, nintendo still didn't gave us updates to fix the bugs

+ the pokemon sprites are really pretty :)


All in all there are just too many things that feel off and take away the fun of the game.
The game just feels unfinished and kinda like it shouldn't even be for sale the way it is right now"

I hink haven't had a good experience witha Pokémon games since Black and White 2, this game made me fell in love again withthe franchise and even with all their faults I had an incredible experiencez there are som many things to do and now it's bug free, so you can play it really well, the only thing is the fps drops but it's not that big of a deal, I’ll always wish that Game Freak had taken another year or maybe even just a few more months to polish it enough to be playable from the start."

  ",2,"I never thought I'd be saying this about a Pokémon game, but this is genuinely one of the worst games I've ever seen. I can appreciate that this title's ambition is far higher than the last, but in the end, all that really does is send this game crashing even harder into the ground than Sword / Shield. So many parts of this game feels like they were done just to say they did, rather than because it would actually improve the experience. Paldea, the open world that was so heavily hyped up in all the trailers and on the back of the box, is the most empty and creatively bankrupt locale I've seen in any video game. It offers, with no exaggeration, nothing to do beyond your typical Pokémon shtick. That shtick is the saving grace of most Pokémon games, even the more mediocre ones, but Scarlet / Violet somehow found a way to butcher one of the strongest gameplay loops in this industry’s history. Battles move at a snail's pace with the overabundance of pointless text boxes and needlessly extra battle animations which you can’t disable (unlike literally every other game in the series), catching wild Pokémon feels oddly clunky and similarly slow, most trainers in the wild can be skipped without any effort (unlike literally every other game in the series), and the mindlessly easy difficulty of Sword / Shield has sadly carried over here. More than any other Pokémon game I’ve played, Scarlet / Violet feel like a constant grind without any real point. And unfortunately, there isn’t much else that can really salvage such a broken combat system. The story possibly comes the closest to doing that, but still falls somewhat short. It’s certainly a lot more ambitious than prior Pokémon stories, with some twists and turns that genuinely surprised me, but that doesn’t stop it from being a story in a Pokémon game. Pokémon isn’t a franchise known for telling gripping stories (at least not the mainline titles), and for my money, what holds most stories in Pokémon games back from being any exceptional is the downright abysmal script and pretty weak attempts at worldbuilding, both of which plague Scarlet / Violet to varying degrees. I did notice that the script for this game specifically was better than prior titles, but it’s still overall reads as super unnatural to me. And while the worldbuilding should’ve been a slam dunk now that Pokémon has gone open world, any attempts at building a world that I could get lost in are absolutely **** by graphical defects and persistent slowdown. I understand that a game’s graphics are not the sole factor in determining its quality, but it's still important. Graphical consistency is crucial to building immersion, but consistency must be the bane of this game's existence because the atrocious presentation and performance absolutely murders any immersion I could muster. It is one of the ugliest games I've seen from any triple A studio. It's bad by PS2 standards. The state in which this game released in is unacceptable; full stop. Not just because it launched blatantly unfinished, but because it still has yet to be fixed. Even on version 3.0.0, I still found this game succumbing to many of its launch issues, namely a frame rate that, I swear, dips to single digits whenever you go near a town. This is a gross anomaly, not just for Pokémon but for Nintendo as a whole. Scarlet / Violet is the type of broken, buggy, unfinished mess that Nintendo fans would brag about never getting. In my eyes, this is Nintendo’s Sonic '06. And much like Sonic '06, while it’s fine to like it for what it is, you cannot deny that we deserve better. YOU deserve better."

  ",3,"Whilst many past iterations of Pokemon have found a balance between targeting both the childrens and adult market by making the games simple but not babyish, Pokemon Violet and Scarlett are incredibly babyish , simple and EASY. This is by far the easiest Pokemon game, the most failsafe, the most braindead toddler level storyline.

They have almost completely removed the challenge from these games, which was basically the case in sword & shield but thisgame goes a step forward.

From a technical aspect the pokemon games have always lagged behind other nintendo games which in turn lag behind industry standards by about a decade, and industry standards lag a few years behind the gold tier once in a blue moon games such as Red Dead or Balders gate 3. Without being harsh Scarlet and violet are at about the mid to late 2000's standard of gaming, if you compare them to Final Fantasy 12, Resident Evil 5, Gran Turismo 4/5, Call of duty mw2 etc then they are definitely running around the same level of interactivity, the story and overall content is roughly around the game time period too, but in a lot of cases the storylines, cutscenes and in game items in late 2000s games were in excess of Violet and Scarlets.

What really puts these new pokemon games to shame though is the lack of polish, these two games are unfinished. They come across like an Early access steam game, with most of the game fleshed out but the bugs and glitches are plenty and the game regularly breaks. This is definitely not good for pokemon because despite their games always being very simple they've always been solid with little to no bugs.

With the introduction of games such as Palworld we are starting to see developers see the opportunity that Game Freak has left by being lazy and exploitive. We can now see that a tiny indie studio can easily exceed the pokemon games, and provide gamers a taste of the experience which probably should have come about over a decade ago.

The multiplayer is shockingly bad. Like unusable bad. You join each others world and then... nothing? There are no minimap icons or any HUD addons to help locate your friend, no interactivity...nothing. Its like playing your own game solo but occasionally you might see your friend wandering about."

I only got the same glitch twice, where my game crashes, but it is not nearly as frustrating as when you go to the big lake which is in the north west, were the framerate drops drastically.

  ",3,"As a lifelong Pokémon enthusiast, from the Gameboy era to the Nintendo Switch era, I've always been the type to pre-order every mainline Pokémon game, even opting for both versions each time. However, Gamefreak's mishandling of the Pokémon franchise has become intolerable for me. The character designs seem to have lost their essence with each generation, replaced by a simplistic and brash American animation style. The portrayal of geometric shapes and bold lines renders the new Pokémon utterly unappealing, making it hard to imagine them as vivid creatures thriving in the natural world! The subpar game production, modelling, and, even worse, the rendering continues to disappoint. Scarlet and Violet mark the first time in my personal history that I haven't purchased a Pokémon main series game at launch, and I genuinely have no desire to support Pokémon's core games if Gamefreak continues to misuse the franchise. They risk losing a loyal fan who has followed them for decades if they persist in this manner. (The same critic with Scarlet)"

  ",0,"This game is sloppy. point blank. I’m honestly surprised that this game was able to hold anyone’s interest for longer than a week. one of the most visually displeasing games i’ve seen in a minute. i mean ive seen more intricate environments and polished textures on a n64. you can literally see the repeating tiles on the mountains. this game was marketed as this huge expansive open world game, and it’s definitely expansive, but it’s completely lifeless. it’s dead, it’s the same recycled low-poly fields and mountains. if your lucky there will be a cave that would be considered average on a game cube. outside of the lazy visuals, battling (which is the whole point of the game) is painful at best. it is mind numbingly slow, we didn’t need every effect read out to us. this part really killed it for me. with how awful the regions look it doesn’t help that i’m forced to be in them for ages because there are fifteen grimers within a 10 foot radius that take 5 minutes to battle each. for some reason they removed buildings having multiple rooms?? if even one?? towns are not explorable anymore, 80% of the buildings you can’t even access and half of the ones you can are the SAME STORE in a different place. i mean in mesagosa there is a corner with the same coffee shop three times right next to each other. there are two shops you can actually enter, the rest have just been reduced to a menu. i also wasn’t a fan of the whole sandwich building mechanic, there is no clue given on what the ingredients do (which i could have just missed? but even if i did i feel like it should be written in the item descriptions). 

the gyms weren’t the best either. i will say i did enjoy the gym leader avatar designs, but honestly that’s about it. there was zero level scaling, which is one of the biggest components in making open world games work. it’s marketed as though you can take on these gyms in any order you want but you really can’t. after one or two your forced to go back and play the “correct” way. the tests you have to go through are boring and they would be unmemorable if they weren’t so awful that it’s hard to forget (i’m talking about the olive race).

this game is a perfect example of an amazing franchise realizing that they will get billions of dollars no matter what garbage they release. it’s honestly sad. i spent 60$ on this game, that’s seven hours at my job. and over 23 million people bought this half-assed game. this happens when a company wants to push out a new game every single year because god forbid they wait two years to get their billion dollars. it’s a scam. even if you somehow like it, you were still scammed because no matter what the glitches and frame rate make it hard to even play at all and the visuals are huge steps down from past releases. and i’ve seen some people say you can expect the switch to run huge detailed games but look at other open world games like tears of the kingdom. this franchise knows how to make a good game, they’ve just gotten used to everyone buying their games without a second thought."

U can’t even enter buildings, can’t talk to many NPCs just to a few which is very depressin cuz it doesn’t feel like an RPG nor a Pokémon game to me tbh.

The stories of the main game and the DLCs are really awesome and for me one of the best at all but most of the features of the DLCs coulda been implemented in the main game and shouldn't be sold as extra context.

And sure sometimes it catches them off guard but it is in my experience far and few between. And the ability to toss pokeballs and attempt to catch the pokemon without battling was great. I wish they continued **** character customization is disappointing. The uniforms could have been cute but nah. Would've been better to make it a mandatory thing when going to class. And I get that the actual character had several options for the face the hair and such. But but no matter how nice a character looks bad clothing will ruin that. The clothing stores are misleading. It should be called an accessory shop. It's a massive downgrade. Like they didn't have to make them gender locked they could've just made the clothing avaliable for all. They shouldn't get praised for something boring like that. And it's not so unbelievably awe inspiring. It's a way to not put effort into it. What's easier and what costs less money?a lot of different clothing items and layering and colors. Or duplicate accessories but color change it. One is far less creative. They are so boring and the uniforms do not look cute. The hair was okay, there wasn't so much options it was overhyped. I love the face options.

If there is water nearby or a vast view of the map, your game is going to slow down significantly. 
Also, the battles are not very aesthetically pleasing to watch. There are stunning 3D models of each pokemon and some very cool animations for the initiation of a move, but the actual impact of a move to an opponent is really dull.
If you try your best not to let these 2 things take away from your experience, you are going to have a lot of fun. Just needed running on a better console."

  ",8,"I have played since gen 1, and it's the most fun I've had in a Pokemon game. The story is amazing, and I love how the three stories converge, and it's done naturally. The music is also fantastic, my favourite being the final boss. It's not without it's flaws though, the most prominent being the frame rate drops and occasional glitches, although that didn't take away the fun I had playing this game, but I understand how it could be a deal breaker for some.Overall it's a step in the right direction, and I hope Game Freak can fix the frame rate issues and glitches in future games, because if there weren't any performance issues, this would be close to a 10. Highly recommend if you're a fan of Pokemon, and if you don't mind occasional frame rate drops and glitches"

  ",1,"My one Advice:
Have 6 year development cycle. 

My Review: 
Can’t believe this game released in this state and so close to the gen 4 remakes and legends Arceus. It’s so backwards the lack of modern quality content makes this unbearable, lack of voice acting, Not Polished, Performance is yuck,  selling point was finally having a open world but the world looks awe full its visually appalling, it’s hardly lived in, there is barely anything going on in this world outside of laggy pop in & out Pokemon. 

I don’t feel like I’m connecting with the people in this world, The buildings can barely be entered anymore they removed previous positive existing content like that, and no improved Legend: Arceus Catching Mechanics in this either. 

It honestly broke my heart as I had hope for and really enjoyed the concept of Paldea, the location ; they hardly focused on the rich cultures of Portugal & Spain as much as they have with Japan in previous iterations. 

Also, I can’t believe this was approved for release in this state. It was sold as fully priced $70 games, how was this approved? I Won’t be buying DLC and honestly this may be my last Pokémon game, There’s so much better games."

I played through it, the story did not at all keep me engaged, but the battle mechanics were at least slightly interesting to me. Then, when Tears of the Kingdom released, I began to realize just how poorly this game was optimized in retrospect. The framerate is abysmal, the graphics are painful, and I question why it was chosen to release in such a painful state. I hope much consideration is put into ensuring the next game in the series does not experience these same faults."

The only good thing are the character models, everything else is just ugly. Storywise this is one of the better Pokemon Games and most of the characters are very likeable. The open world wouldve been good if they wouldve added levelscaling. Without levelscaling the open world honestly doesn't make sense. Lets talk about Tera. Tera is fun and so good for competitive (Singles and Doubles). Its by far the best mechanic for CP imo. The Pokémon Designs are good, i like that they are so goofy. Paradox Pokémon are also really cool. The idea of three different paths is also really good and levelscaling would really help to make this even better. The soundtrack is kinda disappointing for me. I like most of  the battle themes (excluding the gym leader theme, thats a terrible theme)  but im not the biggest fan of the location themes (excluding some tracks like area 0).

  ",2,"I'm not going to cover the technical and graphic aspects of the game given that many of the reviews on this site are pretty much clear about them. However, it hasn't been emphasized enough how poor even the game design is. If the game was well polished, Paldea Region would still look ugly because the environments are not creatively structured. Many of the wild area stages look like plain and linear terrains with some random raised blocks that give a little bit of verticality, while some cities are too similar to each other. There are very few landmarks. In short, the morphology of the region isn't very interesting (a part from few exceptions). This represent a big problem for an open world videogame that is almost all about exploration.
Speaking of open world, I am convinced that Game Freak failed to implement the features of this genre with the classic pokémon videogame structure. In particular, the pokémon level system clashes a lot with the open world genre. A consequence is that the game becomes extremely easy if you are over levelled compared to the pokémon/trainers of a certain area, or it becomes artificially difficult if you are under levelled compared to the pokémon/trainers of another certain area. This happens frequently given that you are given the opportunity to explore freely the region and it makes the game unstimulating, sometimes even frustrating. 
But artificially difficult doesn't mean actually difficult. The impression that I have is that the game doesn't really want to challenge you, even when you're theoretically in a disadvantageous situation. For example, many npc trainers run suboptimal sets on their pokemon compared to their respective level and they are scripted to make moves that let you defeat them with more ease. Gym leaders are very disappointing for these reasons. Only a few battles in the conclusion are kind of challenging, but it's also true that the final boss fight is a joke because game designers decided to make that fight literally impossible to lose. 
So, is the gameplay problematic? Yes, a lot, and if I say this it's also because of some gameplay mechanics that are horrible. One notable example is the automatic battle, which occurs when you go to the Team Star camps. This kind of battle is probably the most boring feature in the game: they give you a ton of time to defeat brainlessly random groups of pokémons by pressing one button, all this with no exciting animations. Absolute garbage, what the heck did the developers think while programming this nightmare?! But there are many examples of gameplay mechanics that I don't like, like the tera raid battles and the picnics, which are in my opinion worse versions of dynamax raid battles and campings from Pokémon Sword/Shield.
I also want to analyze another relevant aspect of the game: the pokémon themselves. When it comes to pokémon designs it's difficult to judge them objectively, given that we have different tastes. However, in this generation, Game Freak has been objectively very lazy during the ideation of the new pokémons and evolutionary lines. One example? The Pawmi, Pawmo, Pawmot evolutionary line. Between the first stage and the last one there aren't significant differences except for the dimensions. There was no need to create bigger versions of Pawmi or more little versions if Pawmot, but Game Freak had the brilliant idea to make a three stages evolutionary line so they could reach 100 new pokémons faster. Other examples? Finizen evolutionary line, Dudunsparce and Maushold evolutionary line and so on. This is the first time that I consider the new generation pokémons overall pretty bad.  

I could continue, but I feel I've said enough. I'm not happy to destroy this game, but this is the ultimate manifestation that Game Freak is an incompetent software house. Seeing the potential of Pokémon brand completely wasted like this is so shameful."

  ",4,"Pokémon Violet is Game Freak's first proper attempt to bring the series into an open world format, and the results are dismal.

For starters, the flow of gameplay just isn't as fun in this new format and the world feels hollow and uninteresting.  Catching Pokémon is still joyful to an extent, but apart from that none of the gameplay experience feels worthwhile.  Battles are painfully slow and easy, and there's not really ever much point in using the new Terra forms, despite them supposedly being a major focus of the gameplay and story.  The towns are empty and devoid of character (you can't even enter houses anymore), the different biomes are generic and not memorable, and there's lots of empty spaces without much to do.   Being able to challenge gyms and other story events in any order you want is good in theory, but the execution is lacking as the gyms don't provide any amount of challenge or novelty.  Several of the new Pokemon designs are quite good, but this is a given, as the series has a solid track record of adding fun new creatures with every game; so this is really the bare minimum in terms of accomplishments.  Character customization has seen major cutbacks for some reason, and you're stuck in a drab looking school uniform for the entirety of the game.  In relation to that, I didn't particularly enjoy the focus on the academy, as it's simply less interesting than the standard Pokémon setup and makes your journey feel less special.

The game features simultaneous multiplayer in which friends can play together in the same overworld, but this feature feels under baked as there's very few ways to interact with each other and they aren't very meaningful.

Apart from that the story is really uninteresting for the majority of the game.  I found the few characters who were even slightly memorable to be abrasive and obnoxious to interact with.  I dislike that less of an emphasis has been placed on becoming Champion, it makes the accomplishment feel far less meaningful than in previous titles.  The story does end on a relative high note, but this section is only a few hours long at most and doesn't make up for the rest of the game basically not having a story at all.

The music is decent but it doesn't really feel like it's evolved much since the 3DS titles.

Then there's the technical shortcomings, which remain in a dire state almost a year after launch.  The framerate is horribly unstable, there are numerous visual glitches, and there's a ridiculous amount of pop-in.  These issues are simply obscene to see in a full priced Nintendo published game, and while they don't make Violet ""unplayable"" they still heavily dampen any enjoyment that I might've had with the game's positive aspects.

I'd say that this title should be avoided, while some of the innovations that are attempted are good, it's simply not worth the lackluster performance and uninteresting world, story, and gameplay.  I'd recommend almost any other Pokémon title over this one, if you're looking for one on Switch there's: Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, New Pokémon Snap, Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu/Evee, or the Pokémon Trading Card Game on NSO.  

This is among the worst Nintendo published games ever from my perspective, your time is better spent elsewhere."

Hell the amount of graphical glitches I've seen throughout my gameplay for both games is shocking to say the least. But these games are also not the worst of the bunch.

  ",6,"The ninth entry in the main series of Pokémon, Game Freak has finally begun to innovate on their tried and true formula with the addition of an open-world approach. While the idea is a breath of fresh air for the series, and is generally well implemented, the game suffers from a myriad of technical issues resulting in a drawing but overall distant experience compared to some of Game Freaks stronger entries.  The Paldea region itself, when outside of the cities, feels abit barren and copy-paste at times. While the cities themselves are decently designed and sometimes even provide that sense of awe from some more notable places in the games, they fall short due to a lack of interiors in buildings. This, seemingly brought on by technical limitations, drastically damages the potential feeling of an open-world Pokémon experience.   The soundtrack features some solid tracks, but nothing too notable to make any difference to the mediocre experience of the open world. The strongest part of the game is arguably the ending portion, when it closes off and becomes more linear. This is ironically when the story happens to be the strongest too, and it is some of the best writing Game Freak has done in quite some time now, especially when nearing the climax.   Overall, the ninth generation of Pokémon leave much to be desired with few exceptions. Ceruledge and Armarouge come close to some of the greatest designs in Pokémon history, but it seems that the rest fall terribly short. The box legendaries, though powerful, are gimmicky and underwhelming. And aside from Chien-Pao, the Ruinous Quartet also leaves much to be desired. The battle gimmick for this generation, Terastallization, turned out to be a surprisingly solid idea and if iterated on, will forever change Pokémon battling. This gimmick can be used once per battle and turns the typing of the Pokémon to a third type. Although the visual effects of this phenomenon leave much to be desired, bringing on that never-ending wish for the return of Mega Evolution. Though the game has the desire to innovate and introduce new ideas, TM crafting being a prime example **** open-world concept, it ultimately falls short of its goal. While a large amount of this can be blamed on technical limitations, it’s hard not to argue that Pokémon would fair better in it’s tried and true linear form. While the open-world is a welcome addition, it could have used some time to polish. Though not the worst the series has to offer, it fails to capture the feeling of some of the earlier entries."

- Low render distance and FPS. Pokemon literally spawn inside you because the render distance is so short.

- The whole theme of this game is visiting an academy. You enter the academy a total of TWICE in the main story for a total of 10 minutes. Must've graduated off screen!

- There are barely any new Pokemon introduced in this ""new"" generation.

- There is no post game after finishing the story. None at all! Stop looking! Or pay 30€+ for the DLC!

- All characters have zero personality. They are just happy residents of the continent. How interesting, right?! Even the ""villain"" team is just a bunch of misunderstood nerds.

- You can ride a Pokemon like a bike, even glide on it. Sounds good right?! NO. The faster you travel, the more problems you see with the render distance and FPS drops mentioned previously.

- You can customize your character! Only problem, the majority of outfits straight up **** massive D!

- There are barely any legendary Pokemon. The only ones you can find are hidden behind a stupid mechanic that forces you to explore the whole map to look for stakes in the ground. 32! Placed so badly, half of them you probably won't find without a guide!

If Game Freak continues like this they deserve to go bankrupt. Sword and Shield at least got the performance and looks part right. This one doesn't even get that done. Hope they either pull their heads out of their asses or another franchise takes up the dropped torch."

  ",6,"after the realease we all know that the game had controversies , because of its poor performance and because of the game optimization , is by far the worst point about the game but there are a lot of other negative aspects .

1. the first negative aspect that you realise just in the beginning of the game is that the variety of the first pokemons you encounter is SUPER blank , in terms of looks , choice and even powerfull pokemons , the pokemons that generally we are looking for in a new gen is of course the new pokemons , but the first couple of pokemons in the route makes that impossible and every person you see playing the game ends up leaving the first route with a fletchling and hoppip.

2. the poor performance of this game is what it makes almost impossible to enjoy , at the beginning everyone who played the game thinked for themselfs "" ah this isnt to bad , clearly has some graphical issues but i can deal with it"" but all of us thought about it before getting into the academy , after that we can see how lame the graphical issues and the performance are even 3ds pokemons games had better performance than this game .

3. the concept of  Crystallization at first look it looked interesting and fun but after playing the game for a while you see how useless and boring it is , was something just to ""had"" since shield had dynamax version but tbh it would be better without it .

4. the story , it is good , i saw some people saying that the game was probably one of the best stories in pokemon and could compete with black and white but that is the biggest lie anyone could tell you about this game , the story is good? debatable , why you ask? because the only thing really good about the story of the game was the final who gave us a little bit of more emotion about the story and nice little flavor like "" this was a interesting experience , not the best , not the worst , but it had potential"" but the final apart the story is like a 6/10 .

yeah overall its not a good experience just for the fact that any possitive aspect will be almost unrelevant because of its performance , makes it almost impossible to enjoy , its not the worst to tho its a experience that you end with mixed feelings , but majority of your walkthrough will depend of how much you love pokemon."

Wether it be Pokémon Presents full of mobile game ads for 25 minutes with absolutely no substance, the lack of effort & passion from GameFreak & the mentally ill take that we NEED a Pokémon game yearly. You could be fooled by the disgusting amount of money these games made, but this franchise has ROTTED from the inside out. The sense of hope that Legends gave me was obliterated, I really can’t put into words how much Violet crushed me. At least the music is still good even tho I wouldn’t put it in my top 5 of the franchise’s OSTs. Area Zero is my favorite area in the history of Pokémon with it’s Xenogears-like theme. There’s some new Pokémon that have good designs but I wouldn’t call most of them super memorable.
But this is easily the worst looking “modern” game on the market & the worst optimized. It’s been talked about to death but these games are nearly a year old with ZERO updates to fix the CONSTANT frame drops. It turns my stomach that they’re selling $35 DLC before addressing a SINGLE ISSUE that got this game clapped in review scores. Nothing will change either, cuz YOU IDIOTS keep buying these broken PS1 products. Sorry Nintendo **** eaters, merchandise deadlines are NOT a valid excuse for how these games were released. When you really want to suffer, just play online! The raid system & online functionality + interface is *somehow* even worse than Sword & Shield. Raids are simply broken, they weren’t even fun for a short time like D-Max in the last gen, they are a SLOG to this day & you’re better off doing it with AI trainers offline. After playing other RPGs this year like Final Fantasy X & Xenosaga III, there is no reason the battle & catch systems are so SLOW in these games. Those are PS2 games that I could do 2-3 battles in by the time the slogs in Violet were done. BTW, Legends Arceus fixed this issue LITERAL MONTHS EARLIER, if they didn’t have time to implement the QOL features from PLA, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE DELAYED THESE PILES OF CRAP. Why ditch PLA’s lighting fast catching mechanics? Why ditch PLA’s shiny spawn noise when this game forces you to look at the 240p environments for the slightest difference in a Pokémon’s model, some being too small or indistinguishable to even notice? Especially when a lot of them don’t spawn until you are LITERALLY RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM, WASTING EVEN MORE TIME GETTING IN & OUT OF BATTLES WHEN THIS WASNT A PROBLEM IN PLA. The gulf in quality between the 2022 games are staggering. This game seems custom made to waste more of the player’s time than ever. Fans had the nerve to overlook the CONSTANT technical issues cuz “the game is still fun”. This is the most MISERABLE I’ve ever been playing one of these horrid modern Pokémon games. Were they going for a Death Stranding ripoff? Cuz 90% of this game was mind numbingly boring, an entertaining ending doesn’t save the rest of the game. But I’m giving it too much credit, who thinks this Jurassic Park wannabe plot was well written? You’re telling me SCIENTISTS wanted to bring Pokémon from the past & future to live among the present? I shouldn’t even bother talking about a Pokémon plot but this is the same franchise that gave us the Unova games & we’ll never get a level of quality like that again from these duds.
The sad part is I saw the potential, open world is a direction that can work for Pokémon. But TPC needs to close GameFreak’s doors & get a dev team that has a shred of competence. THEN give the team enough time to make a complete game instead of these yearly proof of concept games we keep getting. A console that’s not weaker than an Xbox 360 would help too! In a just world, we’d get Legends style games as the new norm instead of outdated copy & pasted garbage. Sword & Shield are still worse games, but I can’t lie & say I wouldn’t rather play them than S/V ever again. At least they had a playable frame rate!
My love for Pokémon is 6 feet under by now, year after year of trash followed by a bit of hope in PLA, only for it to crash back down in the grave again with S/V. Unless we get a Legends style direction for the series, I’m leaving this toxic relationship I have with Pokémon. I’d rather play games that are made with a shred of passion, from people with a shred of dignity. Pokémon Violet is the last Pokemon game I’ll ever touch otherwise. I just wish more fans would’ve stood for something & followed suit in wanting better from a franchise that IS capable of such, instead of giving Nintendo their biggest paycheck yet. The biggest media franchise of all time only has this skidmark to show for itself. Self inflicted wounds tend to **** like that."

The series has become easier and easier and I can see why the pokemon company would this and that's to make it easier for people to play the game. This game was an absolute joke when it comes to seeking a challenge. The story was okay but the fact that I had trouble with only 1 gym leader and that the only place that was even remotely challenging was area zero makes this game obsolete. Over the years pokemons designs have continued to plummet and with the recent news with the dogs like Riakou and Suicune becoming dinosaurs the designs just keep looking like utter crap. It is as if someone from the design team left their iPad unlocked and their children got ahold of it and designed something and pokemon company said ""Okay we will go with that"""

  ",2,"Perhaps the single-most soulless, bland and pathetic Pokémon entry thus far, that only insults the beloved franchise as a whole.

The now-infamous performance problems and visual issues aside, here are some criticisms of the game design itself;

- The game is presented as 'open-world', this is only true conceptually, not in practice. The lack of a level-scaling system for wild Pokémon, trainers, and gym leaders effectively gates the player into following a linear path around the map, otherwise you are very quickly defeated or trapped in encounters you can't run from.

- The 'open world' is purely transversal, where no thought has gone into making it in any way unique or interactive. It's simply a stretch of empty space between locations, with the occasional building ruin or broken down pickup truck that serves no purpose other than to try and break the monotony.

- Pokémon on the overworld only exist to move around, there is little to no interaction between them with each other nor with their environment, they move and lie down to sleep, that's about it. Biomes are poorly constructed and weather systems don't affect species that appear; fire types are present in rain, water types wander around on grass under the sunshine, dark types are found in caves rather than rock or ground types, ghost types appear at night - this is the only attention to detail found within the spawn system. What's worse is that spawns usually result in dozens of the same species appearing and saturating the area, rather than smaller numbers with more species diverse.

- Pokémon designs themselves are still reminiscent of balloon animals with no depth or discernible features, eyeballs for example are still white orbs with a black dot, slapped on to the face rather than sculpted into it. Some surface textures have been improved slightly, but we're a long way off from believable skin, fur, scales, and feathers.

- Catching has now reverted back to the battle screen interaction format, despite PLA introducing the widely-praised overworld Pokéball throwing system. Weirdly enough, you can aim and throw a ball at Pokémon here, but only to initiate a battle, not to attempt to catch the Pokémon you're targeting.

- The gym challenge has gone back to the old format of inconsequential interactions with uninteresting characters that treat the gym leader role as merely a side-hustle. This is a huge step back from the previous generation, which reimagined the gym challenge as a national sport, broadcast all over the region, with battles taking place in sold-out stadiums full of high-energy spectators, with gym leaders characterised as pro-athlete celebrities who were the pride of their hometown/home city.

- Towns and cities all adhere to the exact same aesthetic, constructed from duplicated assets using the same boring grey-block buildings. Despite having the largest locations in the entire series, buildings generally can't be entered or interacted with in any meaningful way, you can approach the door of some shops or cafés and it instead opens up a menu displaying clothing/accessory assets that take several seconds to load as a preview. Some towns have the exact same shop or café pasted several times in a row and they think you won't notice. All towns are full of copy-pasted static NPCs that again can't be interacted with, instead only displaying a text-box above their heads.

- Battles are horrifically slow, no QoL changes whatsoever have been made to the combat system which at this point is beyond archaic. ""It's supereffective!"", ""It's not very effective..."", ""Critical hit!"" etc. along with status effects each still require their own unskippable text box following the move used, rather than simply being incorporated as a splash effect upon use of the move itself. Animations are recycled from generations past and have not been streamlined in any way.

- The in-game camera is pitifully slow and there are no options to change its speed. The camera itself has a fixed active preset so it constantly moves against your own inputs to face in the direction your player faces. The camera can also be controlled in battle, yet defaults to a flat overhead view and resets your movements after every turn, the dynamic camera system with multiple angles from the previous generation is now gone too.

- Cutscenes cannot be skipped without changing an in-game setting to skip them *all*. Rather than simply provide a means to skip a specific scene as it's happening, as most other games do, your options are binary - you must either watch all cutscenes or none of them.

- The lack of voice acting and the text box with the chiming sound effect is no longer a quirk of the series but an example of how far behind the times it is. Emotional scenes are completely diminished by the lack of spoken line delivery, music is used constantly and inappropriately to cover up the lack of voice acting, otherwise there would only be silence."

  ",0,"Pokémon has always had its fair share of shortcomings and hiccups. The games have always been rushed most of the time, yes even and especially before X and Y, but if someone told me during Gen 7 that in two generations they'd release $60 main series games significantly more half-baked than any other core series game, are less stable than Generation 1, not even have basic lore explained for the legendary mascots in the main story, give less postgame than any of the games from Crystal to USUM, and have their actual postgame placed behind a $35 paywall while other companies are pushing out some of the most legendary releases ever on the same console, I would have not believed them. They've stooped to far bigger lows than ever here and it's quite shocking to get this for not only the pedestal Pokémon is on, but the console it's on and the company allowing those games to be published in the first place.

Unfortunately we're in this position because they know their games will sell millions no matter what. There has to be no bigger component than this.

What we received from Gamefreak is fully unacceptable for a AAA company ran by the biggest media franchise in the world, especially as games meant to run an entire generation of events, merchandise, competitive scenes, fanmade content, anime, TCG, and other forms of media. The ""story being good"" simply cannot cut it here. Pokemon will die with Scarlet and Violet being defended. If you genuinely care about this franchise at all, stop defending these games."

  ",2,"I only created this account to give this game a bad review, I hate it that much. As a passionate fan of the Pokemon franchise this pile of 10 fps garbage really hurts my heart, hardly ever was I that disappointed.
I dont even want to mention the few things this game actually does right or at the very least okay, because there is nothing that this game does better then any other of the Pokemon games and that could motivate me to play past the relieving credits.
First, as everyone knows who saw eally anything of the game, its a technical desaster. I have a really high tolerance for pretty bad technical performances, I played Fallout New Vegas on a day 1 PS3 and loved it, but this game doesnt convince me to look past the absolutely horrible technical issues it has on mass.
And, as nearly every Pokeom game is, this game is way to easy, even for Pokemon standarts. You can just blast through absoluitely everything and even skip earlier stroy events for the entire game, what makes them an absolute joke when you finally engange with them.
Why tf does the player ride a god damn motorcycle?! I theorize they did it because some people found it awesome in Botw, I hated it anyways, but they forced the two weels on pokemon even. The cover legendaries! It is not even hilarious anymore, that is outright a war crime.
And they really took too much inspiration from Botw and worked it out very, VERY poorly. The nuture zone in Pokemon Sword and Shield worked quite well because it wasnt so big and sprawling, thus never as empty as Paldea feels. Everything looks uninteresting, you can interact with nothing and it looks like they just let a toddler spam Pokemon onto a plain. It isnt fun to traverse these leftovers of a landscape, it feels like the worst thing you could do with a modding tool.
And adding to that, all of the cities that should act as the islands of interaction and fun in that desolate wasteland, are as bland as it could get. You can go into non of the buildings, restaurants are now just a menu on your screen, the arenas are at their absolute lowest point and not a single character really stands out.
Nearly all of the gym leaders are absolutely interchangable, the champ is a joke and the cheepest Cynthia ripoff I couldve imagined, and your two companions are either extremely forgettable and cosplay your neighbors kid from Hoenn or their extremely annoying. Pepper is annoying as hell. At least I think so, my friends really liked his story line in fact. I just guess that I was so pissed off by everything I played through that I couldnt bring up the patience for his stroy line at all.
And coming back to the fact that everything feels remote, empty and meaningless, none of the characters, not Team Star, not your companions, not anyone interacts outside their little pockets of camps or cities. The ""evil"" team is never really established as a serious threat, they mocked one student, but thats it. Every other game has the evil team cause trouble here and there, sometimes even very serious one. But Team Star isnt presented in that manor at all so they hust are a bunch of children who are missing out on school and drive monstertrucks. (Seriously wtf)
And going further, a factor that contributes to the overworld feeling so boring, which is the main selling point of the game, is that they feel like the exact same location with another bucket of paint on them. That is heavily supported by the usage of the same music piece throughout several different areas. The music in Pokemon in general is really, really good and has a lot to do of how we feel about the games, in my opinion. But this game has not really that great music, only the theme from the east zone really stuck with me.
Back to the samy areas, all of them feel the same because nearly all of them are equally wide and empty and there never is a unique route like, for example route 8 and 5 in Galar. You never have a different expireince, you just bike through everything and thats about it.

I wont buy the DLC for the game, it already disappointed me more than enough. It just makes me angry what GameFreak has become and that their garbage games are selling so damn good. It really angers me as I sencerely love Pokemon and what it can and could be. I just hope that the ones responsible got fired or something."

Pokemon has to push games out in order to sell merchandise, TCG products, anime etc. Because of this, the games are rushed and can't be polished in a way that they deserve. I truly believe this game is a high 8 or 9, but is held back so much because of time constraints.

  ",10,"Pokémon Violet is a truly remarkable addition to the Pokémon universe, offering a fresh and immersive experience for both new and seasoned players. The game successfully reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pokémon with its commitment to a truly open world, allowing players to explore late-game areas full of powerful trainers and Gym Leaders from the very beginning.

The game features three main storylines, including the traditional Pokémon Gym challenge, a plot involving student delinquents, and a quest to defeat the Titan Pokémon and obtain the Herba Mystica.
These storylines are intertwined with emotional narratives and fun mechanics, making Pokémon Violet a more complex and engaging experience than any other in the series.

The open-world exploration is further enhanced by the addition of crafting TMs, which teach Pokémon new moves and encourage players to gather items throughout their journey.
However, it's important to note that Pokémon Violet does have some performance issues and graphical glitches that can't be ignored.
Despite these flaws, the game remains a stunning glimpse into the future of the Pokémon video game series, with ambitious gameplay and thoughtful narratives that captivate players from start to finish.
In conclusion, Pokémon Violet is a must-play for fans of the franchise, offering deep stories, innovative gameplay, and a truly open-world experience. While it may have some technical issues, the overall experience is undeniably enjoyable and a testament to the potential of the Pokémon series moving forward."

  ",4,"It's absolutely maddening to me that ANYONE can say that this is the best Pokemon game since gen 5 or whatever their favorite generation is.
This game is almost entirely irredeemable in how bland, tedious, formulaic and boring it is. I'm a fan since Pokemon Yellow... or rather I was a fan, I haven't liked a Pokemon game since gen 6. Every gen after that has been a drop off the cliff into mediocrity.

Firstly let's start with the latest feature. The open world. Gamefreak, the owners of Pokemon, a franchise that dwarfs the likes of Call of Duty still can't make an artistically pleasing 3d game that runs smoothly. This is one of the worst running and worst looking Switch games available and it's not only embarrassing for this ultra rich mega company but it's disrespectful to the fanbase. The incompetence is dumbfounding. They have all the money in the world and they still can't hire enough talent to make a decent game anymore.
There's NOTHING to do in this open world. You can collect items, Pokemon, battle pointlessly weak trainers spread out randomly across the empty fields and that's it. Exploration is rarely rewarding, everything looks and feels the same.

Story, I guess the bar has been set so low that any trash can please the fanbase now. There's three storylines that.... well they function. They're fine. Basic anime tropey crap that is serviceable but you'd think Gamefreak had written a masterpiece. It's dull, it's predictable, it exists to give purpose... I guess. I'll admit to not having finished it, I needed one more team star and the elite four but the game is just too boring and I refuse to punish myself more. You can help a dude make sandwiches and help his Pokemon, if you turn your brain off it's a basic feel good anime plot. You have you weird hyperactive super talented genetically modified rival who is always really happy and excited for no reason. Oh great cool. The third path was so repetitive and dull I can't even recall it. It's all some variation of battling repackaged with a slightly different plot line with very little hook. The world is dead, the characters are basic, why should I care? Why should you?

Gyms, they exist... Level scaling isn't a thing though in their free open world so the game is either going to be a breeze if you like tediously curb stomping every npc trainer before the gyms, or it's going to wall you with levels and you'll have to go grind with those same tedious braindead trainers over and over and over.

Oh and they introduced temporary TMs again, I think they're called TRs? And guess what? You get to craft them by grinding! Isn't that fun? No. No it's not. It's pointless, it's a regression of the previous reusable TM system, and it only serves to pad this already painfully tedious disgrace to the franchise.

Oh and towns aren't unique or interesting anymore. There's not really any buildings to enter, except the gyms which all look the same. There's also like multiple of the same shop slapped around the larger cities in some baffling attempt to bring life to the area by making it clear the dev team didn't care about the city feeling like it's in a magical world of pocket monsters.

To top it all off character customization has been utterly butchered. Sword is a terribly dull game too but at least you could make your character yours. Now because Gamefreak made a new better character model they would have had to make new clothing models and textures, so they decided to be lazy and not do that. You get one outfit with three slight variations and a few socks, backpacks and hats. I'd like to remind you that Gamefreak COULD have the biggest development team of any single development company and they simply choose not to, because they're idiots I guess.

I'm just exhausted with this franchise. Every generation since 6 just gets worse and worse and worse. Uglier, grindier, duller, easier and btw I'm fine with an easy option for peeps that don't want to grind or deal with battle difficulties. Cool, just like, can we make that an option?

If you gave this game a 7 or more, ask yourself what you really like about this game. Ask yourself what you really liked about Pokemon, cause this slop is nothing but a shadow of its former self. This game has one of the worst open worlds to date, the kind of Ubisoft style open world that's used as an argument for why open worlds ****. Then all you have left is Pokemon but worse in every single way. I can't anymore. I couldn't finish Sword or Violet. Amateurs on RPG maker make better Pokemon games than this utter tripe. Please, as a fanbase can we have some quality standards? And no I don't mean a mediocre game that runs well, I mean a GOOD game that runs well, something that like Pokemon R/B/Y was at least ambitious for its time and console. Not the bare minimum full of bugs and mediocre even when its running bug free."

  ",7,"Pokémon Violet presents many interesting and fun ideas, but unfortunately many of them are poorly executed. The premise of three routes or plots in this game seems unique to me, but the ease of many mini-games or challenges presented in Gym Leaders or Team Star discouraged me a bit. While many Pokémon are well designed and recreated in their habitats, the lousy performance of the game terribly affects that sense of immersion with the Pokémon you encounter and the gameplay. All of this gave me the feeling that the game definitely needed more time, something Pokémon has been having a lot of trouble with lately, and their recent games speak for themselves. I hope that this in the future will change, and that these Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games will allow the Pokémon Company to rethink their priorities; where quality is above the amount of money they generate by wanting to release games on specific dates so as not to lose the economic business model they have. This business model, by the way, is affecting the company's image regarding the quality of their games. I, as a veteran fan of the Pokémon saga, know that they can do better and give more, and get out of that comfort zone."

I bought this game at release and stopped playing after a couple hours due to how many game-breaking bugs I was experiencing and waited for an update. Some months later I've delved back into the game, and the update has some minor fixes but this still feels like a very unfinished game.

At the core of the gameplay, of course Pokémon is a solved franchise - solid turn-based combat and a capture system, however this game breaks so often that even the tried and tested formula of the franchise doesn't redeem it."

However, the technical state is disgusting both visually and performance wise, especially since I know the switch can handle games like Breath of the Wild, and Fire Emblem engage which run and look better. The new gen pokemon are grim if I'm to be frank though this is an subjective view. Though lack of voice acting isnt a point against it, it does start to grind on your gears when story battles have characters interrupting the action to talk, with no voices, cut scenes running with no voices. What is the point of attempting to be cinematic if you can't at least make these concessions. Maybe this should've had another year in the oven."

The game also doesn't run well and during my playthrough it crashed 3 times they may have improved it in updates since I've last played it back in December but I reckon it is unlikely.

Definitely not below a 6, but for sure not a 10.

Has plenty of quality of life improvements, yet takes a step back when it comes to variety of Pokémon in the game. Pokédex is a mess with ancient, semi-old and new Pokémon. Same as with Shield/Sword and Arceus, but worse.
Especially when most of them repeat in almost all biomes, with just higher/lower level.

The performance is awful compared to Arceus or even the not so well performing Shield/Sword.

Story is whatever, pretty bad written in my opinion. Girl apparently steps outside of her house after 10+ years to meet her neighbor?

Academy is lame, professors are ugly and annoying, so are pretty much all encounters on the game.
You can't even tell the gender on a few of them.

Most of the new Gen 9 Pokémon are garbage, there are a few that are good or at least well-designed.
But Pokémon in general went downhill after Gen 4.

Quests/Missions are eh, the “boss” fights are extremely boring.
Terastallize is faster to do than the Raids in shield, but spammed with particles and a time counter that even ticks down when you're forced to watch the text tell you stuff.
Many Pokémon are not obtainable offline again.

Not sure yet, but I haven't found the cord to simulate trades to level up trade-only Pokémon.

I wish they would step back on creating new Pokémon and rather use the old ones or add some more evolutions to them.
The open world is not too bad, but mostly empty. Could've been filled with way more Pokémon.

And the issue with all recent games → gatekeeping Pokémon between both versions. Only obtainable through trade."

Pokemon Ecarlate and Violet are games that are unfortunately made ""hastily"", and this is felt with a technique that is excecrable, worse than that of Arceus. Bugs, clipping, aliasing, everything goes; The artistic direction however saves the furniture, and is better than LPA in my humble opinion. Apart from this ""technical"" part, the game is excellent. It is true that we can note some rhythmic problems because of the long pokemons captures, missing or weakened features in favor of the openworld or a weak post-game. But, its main frame is varied and is a pure pleasure, so addictive. RPG Codes are still as well retranscribed coupled with a lively openworld as air, we are free!!! The lifespan is impressive: 20-30h in rush, 60h if you take your time. We are a long way from Sword and Shield’s failure to take risks or the LPA’s broken promise. Pokemon Ecarlate and Violet is excellent, yes but unfortunately outdated by today’s technique, which makes it ugly."

If I had spent $35-$40 on the game, I wouldn't have been so harsh but spending the amount of money I did for the game while it was severely unfinished felt like a burn of the worst kind.

Still, there is fun to be had. The world is gorgeous and fun to explore, there's lots of new mechanics and content introduced to a Pokemon game, and it generally is a bolder and fresher take on the franchise. While I respect the risks taken, the games technical flaws were simply too many to count and it bogged down every minute of enjoyment I had throughout.

After completing the core game, I decided to sell my copy since I didn't feel much motivation to return to additional side quests or explore further. At that point, my love for the game was long dead and it simply wasn't enjoyable.

I have spent more than 1200 hours into Sword and Shield and I knew that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet wouldn't be the best games on a technical side.

However, these games are technically crap. It is like playing a mid 90 's 3D Game on PlayStation before Mario 64 comes out and sets the standards for 3D-Gaming,

Clipping, bugs and NPC 's which are moving on five fps, when you are not standing next to them. Pokemon can clip into a wall and are not catchable for you anymore. On top a lifeless and empty environment. No city you are visit is appealing to explore, because the only buildings you can enter are the arenas and the ones which you have to, to make progress in the story.

If you enter a shop, only a menu drops in where you can choose what you want to buy.

Or to make it short. Waddle Dee Town in Kirby and the forgotten land is more charming, appealing, full of life and beautiful, than the entire world in Scarlet and Violet.

And if this is not enough, the raids are even worse. Because they simply doesn't work so no fun can be created. The raids are unbalanced, a technical disaster and on top, because of this two major problems are five stars raids or higher online with others not understandable.

The reason is a huge delay even when you play local and your friends are sitting next to you.

This is so embarrassing and disappointing, especially when you see that the new pokemon are all really nice and behind some of them is an interesting concept. I like the new Pokemon of Generation nine overall.

I played this for a few hours but ended up returning it after finding out my favourite Pokemon was cut. Losing the motivation to find your favourite Pokemon coupled with the constant stuttering and camera glitches was too much, and not worth continuing. Gamefreak rushed this game out in such a poor state, and still can't put Pokemon in a Pokemon game, so why should anyone be anything but critical of them.

6/10, because the game is a lot of fun, you can very easily see that when you play it. The problem is that what you see runs at 5FPS.

01/03/2023 - After the v1.2 patch, the game runs significantly better. Hopefully there are still more optimization updates to come, but it is shaping up to be a better game now. The biggest thing the game has going against it is how extremely slow battles are, which unfortunately will probably never be updated. 6/10 for now, this is what the game should have at least been on launch."

Not because of the technical issues, but because the game is so dumbed down with Exp. Share and auto-battles and the 'open world' aspect is so half-arsed that it just all feels... wrong.

I loved Arceus, I had high hopes of Violet/Scarlet after seeing it being pitched as a hybrid of a traditional game and the new introduced in Arceus, but... while it actually DOES do that to a large degree, it just doesn't work.

To touch briefly on the technical troubles, yes, it runs terribly, objects and people in the distance are extremely off putting as they half load into existence, and I had one complete system crash at one point, so it's an unoptimised rushed mess. But it's Game Freak, it's what they do, Sword/Shield was similar too, so as a series veteran I basically expect semi-broken games at this point, so it's not as big a factor to me as it would be for someone coming in fresh.

I like the new Pokémon, no problems there, and the academy system is OK. But... yeah, the game just feels all kinds of wrong and the series is moving in the wrong direction. Yes, your target audience is younger, but you don't have to treat kids like idiots, they know how to play games, they don't need everything to be baby mode."

  ",0,"I have played Pokémon games since Red/Blue so you can believe me when I tell you this is an embarrassment **** both Nintendo and Game Freak have allowed to be released. I'm not going to elaborate on the bugs or the (bad) performance since pretty much everyone out there already mentions this and I'd just be kicking a dead horse.

Fact: Even if the game didn't have bugs and the performance was constantly 30 fps, this game is FAR from a fun experience and Game Freak clearly fails time and time again to include things the community liked from past games and exclude the ones that weren't popular. Instead they do things nobody was really asking for, like a huge map that is mostly boring and barren or making raids even less fun than they already were in Sword/Shield.

The story in this game is barely something you will remember in years to come and feels more like an afterthought than actually important to the player. Most uninteresting league champion I've seen, even worse than Diantha from X/Y or Wallace from Emerald. Your rival is SUPER annoying and seems to have absolutely no reason to exist but to want to fight you 24/7. Game Freak even went out of their way to design entire conversations in such a way where at the end you're given a choice (yes/no) which is only an illusion since they will force that ""yes"" upon you or you will remain stuck forever.

Trading Pokémon online still remains just as basic as usual, you'll have to give in a code and hope the person on the other side is playing the other version. Don't know why they cant just make it like the Online TCG where you can book trades, or filter them. This is just as tedious as 20 years ago where you had to connect both consoles with a cable.

Game Freak also did a terrible job of explaining most of the new mechanics of the game to the point where you have no choice but to look online for answers. This feels like the old days when people had to read a magazine to know where to go to or which NPC did what. But everyone knows that's crap game design nowadays.

They have somehow managed to make a game that is graphically worse than Sword/Shield, Let's Go or Arceus. By worse I mean that they put priority in making it 100% open world even if it means the decision is detrimental to both looks and performance of the game. I'd rather have a game that is 2D, 2.5D or even linear 3D but is well built and inviting instead of a Zelda/Elden Ring copycat because the copy is seldom better than the original and most of the time creativity will suffer.

These people out here giving this game scores of 10 are either fake bots employed by Nintendo themselves to try to save the average score, or they have no clue and just autobuy anything with Pokémon in the name and are incapable of critical thought and actually looking at the game from an unbiased perspective. There is NO excuse for both Nintendo and Game Freak to make a game this bad and lackluster in 2022 with all the experience and community feedback they have accumulated over 25 years.

PS: If you're sceptical because this is my first and only review on Metacritic, just know that Pokémon Violet has infuriated me to the point of actually taking the time to write this."

I want to say that i'm a pretty chill pokemon fan, I enjoyed more or less every title, even sword and shield. This game is truly an insult to the player. It runs just like in the meme videos, laggy all the time, mountains, trees, bushes, entire pieces of landscape appear and disappear, trainers will animate weirdly and sometimes flat out dissapear. The game is ""open"" and you ""can go where you want to"" which is a flat out lie. You have access to every area of the game but the game still has them set out in a level progression. I went with a lvl 10 team to an area where the pokemon were level 35 and as you can imagine i got my ass kicked. Sometimes its fun I'll give it that but it feels worse to play and enjoy compared to any title released so far. I forced myself to come into it with a positive view but i cant like this game. The game looks way worse than sword and shield, runs way worse, has worse animations. It feels like this is the beta version.

I genuinely like the story, even with it being much more darker than the games I've played. It has relatively diverse characters, some that I can even relate to. There are some characters and aspects of the story that could have been written better but, at this point, I'll take what I can get.

What has really bothered me is the Tera Raids. More specifically, how the Tera Raids only have a certain amount of time for players to defeat the Tera Pokemon. That also includes how time is taken away whenever a Pokemon faints. I personally believe they should have kept the same or made a very similar mechanic as to Pokemon Sword and Shield. It could still be frustrating but it was no where near as bad as in Violet and Scarlet. I'll be honest that I can be quick to frustration but I've never been so easily frustrated with time-sensitive games until Violet and Scarlet. I've lost count of how many Tera Raids I, and most certainly others, have lost in a row because of the current time mechanic. The most I would change is taking time away when a Pokemon faints, seeing how the more times you faint, the longer it takes to be revived back into battle. I genuinely believe it would make it a much more bearable game."

I always loved pokemon, been playing them since gen 2, but, they got greedy and are getting away with it because people always buy their games. I'm never getting another pokemon game after this one and here are the reasons:

The performance is horrible, and this isn't because it runs on a switch! There are other titles of the same console that are a lot more beautiful and run smoother;

The graphic quality overall is poor, NPC's and pokemons appear and disappear out of nowhere.

There are a lot of camera clipping issues.

The animations are laggy even when you're not too far from things, some of them are extremely ugly, like when you fall from a high place, your character bounces on the ground berofe popping out the levitating phone to save you.

THE ONLINE GAMEPLAY. Pokemon is all about trading pokemons with your friends and battling them. Nintendo makes you pay a triple A price for a horribly made game and you still need to sign their horrible subscription to play pokemon how it should be played. This should never have been allowed.

Also, there are a lot of problems with how the open world was made. You can exploit the teleport to battle feature to go to places where you shouldn't, I got to the psychic gym (lv45) without even finishing the tutorial. Also, it is an open world game that punishes you for exploring, since you can go to all areas, including the ones with extremely high level pokemon without a warning.

Please Nintendo, take your time and make a good pokemon game, this one could've been the best pokemon yet, but because of your hurry to make money out of kids you're killing what could be a really good experience for everyone."

The characters are arguably the deepest the series has introduced. Each of the players’ friends have strengths and flaws, and are even relatable in ways previous games missed.
The new Pokémon designs are great. There’s a few who stand out above the rest, but it’s definitely one of the better generations for new Pokémon.
The map is great, and the open world was implemented in the best possible way. Where Legends Arceus walked, Violet and Scarlet ran.
Team Star we’re a nice change of pace from the usual evil team.
Telling part of the game’s story through going to class and befriending teachers was a good idea. I originally dismissed the school classes as unnecessary until I tried them, and found them very worthwhile in the end.

The bad;
Game performance. You’ll be lucky to maintain more than 20 fps in the open world. The longer the game remains open the worse the performance. Closing the game and reopening helps to a degree, but not for long. The performance is the only thing I marked the game down for, so believe me when I say it’s bad. I haven’t played a game with performance this bad since I tried playing Crysis on a Windows Vista laptop with less than a GB of RAM."

It's like looking at a table with various slices of cheese laying about, not on plates or anything, just kinda sitting flat on the table. Some slices are slightly moldy, others have cat hair on them, and the rare few that are clean were left out of the fridge for too long and taste somewhat passable, but are a little too soft and dubious to truly enjoy.

  ",2,"If you have a young child who likes Pokémon then they will probably be happy with this game if they receive it as a gift. Other players probably shouldn't waste their time or money.

The well reported graphical glitches make this feel like a budget offering (in an age when even many free to play games have excellent graphics).

The story is standard fare for a Pokémon game - good enough.

The gameplay is sub-par - a failure to move beyond the game's Game Boy origins.
The combat system in particular feels like a relic, made even worse by it's sluggish speed. This combat system would be an embarrassment to even a free to play game. The developers should perhaps take a look at other modern turn based RPGs' combat systems before embarking on their next project.
The UI is also disappointing, many screens lacking information that obviously belonged there.
When playing one also gets a general sense that either the developers or the hardware (or both) were out of their league and they couldn't succeed in making the game that they envisioned. The draw distance of Pokémon has them appearing  out of nowhere just in front of you. The Pokémon wandering around while you battle, often stopping right next to you resulting in a chain of battles one after the other. The lack of any indication of enemy level - in an open world game there needs to be some way to know if you're going somewhere inappropriate for your level, that shouldn't mean entering a battle and only then finding out that the enemy is 20 levels higher than you. This consistent lack of polish just further adds to the feeling of a budget title.

The quality of this product would be appropriate if the developers were making a low budget Pokémon knock off title to make a quick buck. For this to be released as a full priced Pokémon game   the developers should be ashamed."

1. Game lags, barely running above 20fps when moving around.
2. Even when running fine, gameplay and movement feels slow, cheap and sluggish compared to PLA
3. Game stutters/glitches/freezes/crashes, player clips through walls, random flashes on background
4. Why do boxes take FOREVER to load Pokemon Sprites? Can't describe how awfully annoying that is.
5. Let's Go feature is bugged, my pokemon might be cycling around wild pokemon and then returning to you instead of attacking (not talking about encountering shinies)
6. Online raids are broken, constantly glitching, even after 1.1.0 patch.
7. Many uninspired new pokemon and shinies.
8. No set mode really? What kind of genius made that decision?
9. Pokemon don't fit in the screen when battling, especially on double battles, and battle stages are boring.
10. Any texture other than the Pokemon's is low definition and looks outdated.
11. Elite four felt cheap, and you can't battle them again. Champion was indifferent. The whole experience was underwhelming, felt as if I'm fighting on my backyard.
12. No Battle Tower equivalent.
13. You can just clip through your Pokemon, they act as holograms.
14. Still no voice acting. It's the first game of the franchise (and a little bit in PLA) that I really noticed the lack of and wanted voice acting.
15. No shiny indicator in the overworld. Sound and sparkle from PLA was a bit too much but they could add something like a sparkle from the shiny every 2 seconds or something.
16. Post game just doesn't exist. They will sell it next year with DLC for 50$.
17. Mass Outbreak Pokemon have random IVs. It would be way better if it was like PLA.
18. So many features and mechanics from PLA didn't make it. Outfits, aiming, no random wild battles, throwable items etc.They're supposed to be different genres but still, PLA did some amazing things. Why can't a mainline series be action rpg? No one would complain.

Positives:
1. Story is is great for the first time in years
2. Seamless world, you can traverse the map without loading in and out of towns caves etc which is fantastic (for a Pokemon game). Although I dont like the fact that you can go everywhere from the get-go I'd like more restriction.
3. Kept the mass outbreaks and raids.
4. Music was good most of the time except when it glitched.
5. Pokemon textures are great they did a good job."

- They changed the iconic humans art style from the series (why? It's like removing Akira Toriyama's art style from Dragon Quest saga)
- NPCs design are ugly with few exceptions
- Bad performance, some crashes, bugs and frame drops
- The new pokémon design is ridiculous and they don't look like monsters anymore (a half motorcycle lizard? who had this idea? a 5 years old kid?)
- The new cities are forgettable, they have no content, the houses no longer have interior, there is no reason to explore
- Gym challenges are pathetic
- Visual issues like texture pop in or NPCs and distant objects running at 5 FPS

- Rushed game with good and bad decisions, sacrifices quality in favor of innovation"

A game should not be released in a condition where opening the map crashes the game let alone a game where I get crashes on it at-least 3 times a day on my 5 month old new OLED,

When I first started the game my skybox wasn’t even there that’s how broken this game is, I’m tired of defending this game I really do like it but I can’t give it any redeemable points because it simply isn’t complete enough to classify as a game. It is absolutely ridiculous that a game can be released in this condition… I’ve constantly fought against the complaining Pokémon fanbase for years as I think this game is really fun and has so much potential but you absolutely cannot play it at the minute , it is not worth half price and yet they are charging so much for a game that has only been play tested on high tech industry switches and not consumer ones.

My entire play through didn't have a single crash, no lag, nothing. So not really sure what all the fuss was about.

I really enjoyed my experience with this. I rolled credits I think around 60 hours with 320 Pokémon caught. I loved the collecting but getting them all really isn't for me so I'm happy stopping here. I had a full team of dragon Pokémon with a Tsareena as my main team and even then felt quite a challenge. I actually lost more battles in this game more then any other. I also didn't cheese it and kept my Pokémon that I played with consistent with the level to the area and gym and didn't use potions during combat just for the extra challenge.

This had a good open world feel especially the more movement abilities you unlock. Traversing and stumbling on Pokémon was so much fun. I also really enjoyed grinding to evolve some pokemons to try out and switch up my team a bit. The Lets Go feature was so helpful to help with some grind when I wasn't in the mood.

  ",4,"To be blunt, the game has a lot of potential, and with some updates, and, hopefully, changes it could rise to that potential. However, in the state that it is in, best I can do is deem it average. The basic premise of the single player loop is pretty good, but hampered with technical issues everywhere. And for the record, this game is NOT open world until near its completion. The online aspects of it, particularly the raid battles are horrid. Sword and shield were bad, but workable. Unless you have companions to raid with, you’re stuck with completely random raids with very little choice even in the star level. No problem if you don’t do the raids, but certain items are locked behind completing them.  It is a VERY poorly executed idea"

  ",8,"If The Pokemon Company had allowed for an extra year of development, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet would be a 9/10.

These are the most ambitious Pokemon games ever made, and an absolute MUST PLAY for Pokemon fans, standing on par with Emerald, HeartGold, Platinum, Black & White and their sequels.

These games have the best and most compelling writing in the series' history, and the open world concept is executed exceptionally well. Players are given more options than ever, even the ability to control the balance of their playthroughs, basically from start to finish. The map is MASSIVE and highly explorative, and rewards exploration constantly, whether through items or Pokemon. The Terastal mechanic is excellent and adds greater depth of strategy at all levels, all the way from early game to, especially, the competitive level.
The music is Game Freak at their BEST, hindered by Toby Fox's embarrassingly bland contributions.

Reasonable people would do well to keep in mind that these games were given HALF as much development time as Breath Of The Wild and other home console experiences, with most development staff working on Legends: Arceus simultaneously, in order to meet The Pokemon Company's profit quota through annual releases.

As a result, these games have minor, surface level technical and aesthetic shortcomings that are slightly irritating at their worst, and it loses points as a result. Given the that delays in Pokemon games are not permitted by The Pokemon Company, Game Freak made the right decision to prioritise creative vision over surface level polish. My biggest gripe is the somewhat counter-intuitive UI.

A lot of people on the internet are blowing these issues out of proportion, as well as circulating modified footage for clicks and views. All in all, given the merciless business model they have to work to, Game Freak have done exceptionally well."

This recent pokemon title is broken to the point of being unplayable--near Sonic 06 levels of bugs and performance issues, which is the real reason I can't genuinely score this game. Beyond that, it's also the ugliest game on the Nintendo Switch. It looks to be in its alpha state, and most Gamecube games look better and have more polish by comparison. I've seen many people say things like ""but the game is still fun!"" but so are many other games.

However, the game is far from unplayable, and Game Freak actually managed what I consider to be the best story in a 3D mainline Pokemon game. The open-world mechanics, along with the complete removal of random encounters, lend themselves perfectly to the three-prong adventure, and the conclusion was so unexpected and undeniably excellent. You may be wary of picking this game up thanks to all of the group-think hate and review-bombing focused around the graphics and performance, but I actually played through the whole thing and had a great time.

  ",8,"Es difícil hacer una valoración de este juego, ya que como Pokémon nos tiene acostumbrados últimamente, hay aspectos en los que sobresale y otros en los que es nefasto.
No voy a incidir mucho sobre el apartado técnico y el rendimiento, que evidentemente penalizan el resultado final del juego y son inaceptables. Voy, sin embargo, a destacar otros puntos negativos que se han visto algo opacados por esto, como la no existencia de una curva de nivel, que en un videojuego de mundo abierto es incomprensible, ya que deja al jugador a su libre albedrío, haciendo que se rompa en gran cantidad de ocasiones la sensación de reto o la dificultad; la eliminación de algunas mecánicas del ""Leyendas: Arceus"" que hacían al juego mucho más dinámico, como la captura libre; o el hecho de que no se haya traído de vuelta la cámara lucha, cosa que sigue sin tener explicación y que hace más tedioso el acceso a un competitivo que, espero, esté mucho más controlado por parte de TPC que en el caso de Espada y Escudo, donde introdujeron una mecánica rota (Dinamax) y acabaron creando un metajuego excesivamente centralizado y aburrido.
Sin embargo, ahí acaba lo propiamente malo. La dirección artística de este juego ha paliado, aunque no del todo ni mucho menos, los enormes defectos gráficos del juego, y es que ha mejorado mucho respecto a un Leyendas: Arceus donde había árboles de bayas sueltos que no pegaban ni con cola, entre otras atrocidades que restaban inmersión. La historia es, en este juego, un punto fuerte a destacar, siendo en mi opinión la mejor desde los juegos de la quinta generación, tocando esta además una serie de temas muy maduros e interesantes, como el acoso escolar, la relevancia de la figura maternal/paternal o el sentido de la vida; todo ello de una manera ingeniosa y dejando al jugador misterios por descubrir que son esenciales en Pokémon, ya que avivan ese espíritu curioso que habita en todo entrenador. La jugabilidad, por su parte, es en líneas generales bastante buena, como en todo juego de Pokémon: la mecánica de la teracristalización es interesante (quizás algo rota, pero confiaremos...), y hay muchas mejoras ""quality of life"" que mejoran la experiencia jugable, véase la cura rápida. La banda sonora es excelente, como siempre, y sí es cierto que en cuanto a diseño de Pokémon, desde mi punto de vista, se empeora respecto a Pokémon Espada y Escudo (aspecto en el que estos juegos tienen un nivel altísimo), aunque aprueba con creces de igual forma, dada además la gran cantidad y variedad de nuevos Pokémon y formas alternativas introducidos.
En resumen, es un juego que merece la pena jugar, y que tras su brillante historia ofrece un sinfín de cosas que hacer, adaptadas a todos los gustos (""shiny hunting"", Pokémon competitivo, completar la Pokédex...). Ofrece una experiencia muy entretenida, siempre y cuanto estés dispuesto a pagar el precio de soportar las caídas de FPs y los bugs, que están por todo el mapa (todavía)."

i am so mad at gamefreak for rushing this game because as a long time pokemon fan whos played almost every main series game this is genuinely one of my favourite pokemon games of all time only second to legends arceus. im sure that if it didnt come with the insane performance issues it has now on switch then most people would be giving this game amazing reviews because the core of the game is amazing. so much stuff here is the peak of the franchise - the environmental design, the story, some of the graphics (human and pokemon models look great + the 2d aesthetic works really well + anything that isnt part of the open world looks great) + the battles, the characters, the region, the pokemon, the animation, the setting. dont get me wrong it has some serious flaws (main one being performance) but i never really had trouble with most of them
for example while the lack of level scaling does kind of **** it also meant i went into some fights really underleveled (5-6 and even 10 levels under) and got a lot of challenge out of them. these fights ended up being some of my favourite in the series, and im glad i got to experience them even if it meant being overleveled for some other fights and making them a joke

i wont lie, this game didnt look that good going in from trailers but honestly everything i thought was going to be bad was really good for example team star became one of my favourite ""antagonistic teams"" in all of pokemon. my point is even if it looks bad please at least give it a chance

in conclusion gamefreak upper management **** for forcing the yearly release schedule on the developers making them rush an otherwise fantastic game. idk how the experience is on switch but when i dont have to deal with the performance issues and bugs this game is definitely a solid 9/10

a way to improve it would be to take more from arceus like the new catching mechanic and sidequests. they should also make changing the tera type of pokemon easier"

Shield had been fun but it felt like a lot of promises were unfulfilled and with Shining Pearl I felt like they had ruined my favourite of the franchise. Still, all my friends were getting it and with the promises of new multiplayer features I was in. The games story for me has been one of its best. With characters that don't annoy you and a storyline that makes sense and makes you attached. It's not perfect, some voice acting would have made it so much better but it's still a massive improvement on Sword and Shields boring story.

The gameplay has been mostly great, I'm not expecting the 4K 60FPS quality that we are seeing in other main franchises so the fact it could be a bit janky didn't bother me. It does need some polishing and should have been done before release so I understand the hate the game has received but it's still a beautiful game and one I have enjoyed playing.

Multiplayer features work great! I've had a blast with my friends. The ability to continue solo story quests and missions while linked up has meant we could play together every night. Later in the game there's an area that you can't do this with but that's not really a problem when 90% of the map you can. You can travel together, explore and even shiny hunt the same Pokémon! Overall, while I admit it could have been better, potentially the best, I have really enjoyed this latest edition and if you can look past its flaws you can have a good time."

The game is a mess, not just because of the disgusting state it was released.

We were sold on freedom of playing the game in any way we choose, this was false.

Areas all have level variances so do gyms, titan Pokémon, team star bases etc.

The experience does not scale to your personal progress, which would have made the games actually great, since you get badges for completing elements of the game those badges should affect the levels of the content you play, but NO! They took the easy lazy option, what's worse is the Pokémon centres are supposed to guide you through the content to give you a smoothe experience but they send you to content that's closest to you regardless of what level you are, it's not good...

To play the game and have half a decent experience you need to use a guide to follow the true route, oh and you thought you could skip doing certain content you don't want to do because it's monotonous and boring? Guess again, you have no choice but to do it because you need to do it all to complete the main story.

Honestly I've been playing Pokémon  since the beginning in the 90s, the switch games have been a slap in the face, hoping things will improve in the next game, that GF actually listened to feedback and would correct their mistakes, but nope, they've gotten lazy and complacent and worse! because they know their game will sell record numbers regardless.

  ",7,"I've been playing Pokemon for years ""since Red and Blue"" and by far this one has me a bit flustered. The previous games that released didn't have hardly any performance issues this one has currently. And it just had it's first update with no improvements. It soooo laggy at most times, light from the sun and moon clips through mountain tops while playing. They removed the catching feature  that was in Pokemon Arceus ""which was great for catching Pokemon in mass outbreaks"" but they kept the battle feature. Raids are so bugged right now, it gets so frustrating to battle when the bot your battling against buffs itself multiple times and debuffs you before you can even attack! I'm not saying that Game Freak won't fix some of these issues but come on fix the bugs in plain sight first before releasing the game. Stop this trend of releasing unfinished games! But the Pokemon in this game look awesome "" they added fur and scales to certain mon"" which look great. The map is massive compared to the other games and it looks almost breathtaking. Overall I give this game a 7 out of 10."

I agree the performance issues are unacceptable in today's gaming landscape, but if you are a fan of Pokemon GET THIS GAME. It is the most fun Pokemon game I have ever played. The beginning story setup does take about an 1/1.5 hrs to get through, but once you are free to roam the world it is what I dreamed Pokemon could be when I was a kid playing it on Gameboy. Not to mention most people I have heard negatively review this game either just started playing or literally are going off of watching twitter videos that show the worst glitches. I am about 40 hrs in and haven't seen close to the amount of crazy glitches people are showing. Doesn't mean they aren't really happening to some people, but with over 10 million copies sold and everyone piling on it gives the perception of it being worse than what it truly is in my opinion. Also the co-op doesn't get any love and I think that is such an awesome thing they added.

The Bad: The most extreme frame rate and visual glitch problems I’ve ever seen in a Nintendo game. It becomes downright unenjoyable to play at times. Additionally, I’ve rarely played an open world game such as this one that leans so heavily on the structured story. Half the point of an open-world game is the exploration and “making your own story”. This game doesn’t really do that too much, as the open world feels fairly shallow without much mystery or wonder in it. Also, the game is far too easy. I’m not expecting a Nintendo game to be too difficult, but this game is like a light stroll at the park, even for most children. Lastly, there is almost no postgame content. Once you beat the game, there’s very little to do, which has not been the historical case for Nintendo games which usually try to provide a replayable activity or series of particularly difficult challenges unlocked after beating the main game. This game doesn’t truly have that. All-in-all I would not recommend this game to almost anyone. Children may highly enjoy it, but anyone older than 12 years old is going to be frustrated with the lag, glitches, and ease of the “challenges” and bosses."

  ",6,"Pokémon Violet is a good Pokémon game - but it is not a good game, if that makes sense.

It's arguably one of the most fun and most modern Pokémon experiences we've had, which is why everyone is giving this a 10/10, however it is marred by technical issues; poor graphics, poor performance, scummy marketing practices that are a decade-outdated and more.

Despite the Switch supporting 1080p, 60fps, this game runs (docked) at 720p, 30fps - yet the thing is, you'll barely ever get those 30fps, because of the constant stuttering and assets loading in in the background.
In certain areas and cities, you will be lucky to get 20fps, let alone 30fps.
The graphics, despite being much better than some past titles, still pale in comparison to nearly any other modern game - heck, Breath of the Wild still looks better and that game is a good few years old now. Anything in the distance becomes a blur of muddy, tiled texture-work, while when you get close it just slaps the higher-fidelity texture on, with zero fade-in. It's incredibly jarring.
One of the most crazy things is that this game makes Legends: Arceus look fantastic - and although they were developed at the same time, Arceus did come out first, meaning the older game does look better.
It's also still debateable whether they should have settled on Let's Go: Pikachu/Eevee art-style and graphics, rather than this semi-realistic look they are currently going for (and kind-of failing at).
This doesn't even cover the terrible coding this game seems to have, with NPCs and Pokémon dropping to 3fps when they go more than 1 metre away from the player, while when entering a city, the models will pop into existence mere centimetres from the player.

In terms of other cons, the National Dex cut does still affect these games, so be prepared for scummy DLC that re-adds a bunch more mons in.
There's also the topic of the dual-version release, which is still just as scummy as it always was.
Scarlet and Violet, just like Sword/Shield and Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, are the exact same game, just shipped with 2 lines of code differing between versions.
As many dataminers have proved, you can actually get Violet to run as Scarlet using an extremely quick memory edit - which is ridiculous.
This practice should have ended when the internet became accessible (DS era) - but it still exists in full force, to get unknowing/hardcore fans to pick up the dual pack and dual-DLC-pack for the extra $$$. Not to mention the Pokémon Home and Switch Online subs as well.

Now, as I said, these games are fun and are arguably the best Pokémon games in a long time.
For once, the story is actually darn good. Like, really darn good.
Finding Pokémon in the overworld and such is also really nice and exploring Paldea on-top of the box-legend is a neat feature - although I would have preferred the Let's Go version where we could ride any Pokémon we owned.

A big issue concerning the story elements though, is that there is no level-scaling. You can do everything out of order, which is a fresh-take on the formula, but the lack of level scaling means that if you do do things out of order, you might find yourself with level 30 mons against the ""8th"" gym with level 45-50s, or you could have level 60 mons against the ""1st"" gym that has level 14-15 mons.
Essentially, if you don't want to get stomped, or don't want to do the stomping, you need to look up a ""recommended guide/path"" - which then makes the game extremely linear, just like every game before it. Also, because Gym Badges only work based on the caught-level, there is a high probability the player will take their level 5-10 starter and a couple of ""route 1"" mons and power-level to 50+, simply by exploring the map and catching/battling higher-level mons.

I know I keep going kind of back and forth between pro and con here, but that is ultimately what the game is like. For every step forward, there are 1 or more steps backwards. Getting competitive Pokémon and power-levelling to 100 is easy with Raid Dens and such - but then you find out that certain options that were staples, like ""battle mode"" or ""battle animations"" have been completely removed for no apparent reason. Finding nearly the entire Pokédex, either in the wild or in Raid Dens is amazing, but then, due to the terrible pop-in and draw-distance, you will be zooming around on the box-legend and getting into so many tedious and unwanted wild battles, because you will not see the Pokémon you slammed into, before you slam into it.

Overall, I'll rate Pokémon Violet (and Scarlet as they are the same game) a 6/10 on my end. They have potential, but should not have been released in this state - and for how long do we have to keep saying ""it's a step in the right direction"" before we get the game we actually should have on the Switch?"

  ",2,"For $60 dollars, this game is not worth it.  It is not a great open world set up. Instead of populating the world adequately they have multiple shops that sell similar clothes or food in inconvenient locations instead of a single department store. The world feels open, but empty especially with characters that are seemingly missing  frames in the background.  All of these things ruin the immersion. No outfits for your character (pants and shirts) took away from the the customizing aspect that many games have embraced. My starter was my best pokemon and designs for new pokemon  were lackluster. They had ""students"" that were old people in game? A strange, lazy choice. Glitches galore removed you from game play. I have seen better and more complete  indie games.

  ",9,"Alright, the game's a mess, let's be honest here. There's performance issues and many graphical bugs people have memed about. But if you can look past it, the game is superb, with a surprisingly mature storyline (especially the climax) and it feels like a step forward. I've not been able to set this game down since it came out, at the expense of my freelance work, even. The game's just sublime with well-designed characters, a killer soundtrack, and a frankly ambitious level of worldbuilding (even if i'd have preferred it not being open world personally, or at least let it have level scaling)

Taking a point off because yeah, the issues are egregious, if exaggerated, but aside from the performance problems the game's just plain damn fun with some incredibly unique designs that I quite like. It really feels like the company saw the backlash from Sword/Shield and BDSP and pivoted in a new direction where they try to take themselves more seriously and it shows, even if it's rough around the edges.

Should TPCI have looked for a secondary development team to make the world run better on the limited hardware? Obviously. Should they maybe try to migrate away from such a cutthroat yearly release schedule? Absolutely. But what we have here is still a fantastic game at its core and the negative reviews are very clearly overblown and will balance out as more genuine fans have a chance to write reviews, and as promised updates help to stem the performance issues. The game has had a single post-release update and people are already condemning it as the worst entry in the franchise, and when people are saying that somehow BDSP are better games than this it becomes obvious most of the negative reviews aren't made in good faith."

~The Good:
- The story and characters this time are exceptional, especially during the last segment of the game (the main reason why I am replaying the game).
- New Pokemon designs are also nice, with some misses of course, as in every generation.
- Shiny hunting is easier than ever on a mainline game.
- Building competitive teams is also easier than ever imo due to easy access to mints and bottle caps.
- Open world is nice and densely populated with a wide variety of Pokemon and items.
- Solid gameplay loop as expected by Pokemon standards, with a few challenging fights along the way.

~The Bad:
- Performance issues are hurting this game quite a bit. Frame drops in the overworld, a laggy box system, and online features that are somehow worse than last gen's Y-comm. Game is totally playable and I never had a crash, but it can be annoying.
- Some QoL features appear to be missing compared to previous gens. You cannot enter box selection while holding Pokemon in the cursor for example. Some features from Legends: Arceus would also be a great fit for this game, but they are not included.
- Endgame feels one dimensional, wish we had a Battle Tower of some sort to fill the gap.
- Some shiny Pokemon colors are extremely similar to the originals. While this is not a new thing, I wish they would be more radical with shiny color changes.

Overall, very enjoyable experience, would definitely recommend unless the performance issues are a big no for you. Hopefully, we will get a patch that addresses most if not all of these issues soon. The user score does not represent the game in it's entirety imo, as most low reviews seem to be extremely focused on the performance issues."

  ",2,"To be honest, knowing other people's opinions, I bought the game solely because it was inspired in my country. But I just can't play it while seeing the whole world acting randomly in a horrendously bad optimisation and graphics from the past. If the Nintendo Switch is able to make TLoZ: Breath of the Wild work without problems, why does the Pokémon world, which is way simpler in graphics, give us so many problems? The answer is simple: Nintendo wants Pokémon to make money even if the games they throw to us every year are not even optimised enough not to bug every single second.

This game was honestly a deception and I hope the next Pokémon game doesn't come out until 2024 at least, because this one feels void, a relatively open world full of bugs and, of course, short, easy and simple. No effort, no love, a lot of visual glitches. I can't wait to buy TLoZ: Tears of the Kingdom, but I'm not going to pay 60€ for a game that isn't even finished. If the next game comes out in 2023 and seems a deception, I surely won't add it to my collection. Put effort in games or Pokémon's franchise will die sooner than later."

The pop-in, the dropped framerate, the terrible slow loading of assets when switching camera perspectives (such as when throwing a Poke Ball at a wild Pokemon in combat) are all jarringly bad and constant.

I'm sure things will improve somewhat over time, as they at least want to iron out most of the performance issues, but even if they actually FOR ONCE fully fixed a Pokemon game to run well instead of just being good enough (PLA still crashes the game when shiny Giratina uses its signature move, btw; every single time), it is still UNACCEPTABLE for a game to be in this state at launch. There is no reason to have pushed this game out this soon in this state instead of just taking more time to develop it.

The ability to craft TMs, rename pokemon whenever, run from and re-enter battles, open world exploration, outbreaks, tera types, paradox pokemon and the picnic feature, raid dens and more have given me freedom to make my pokemon how I truly want them to be and endless things to do while I have fun doing so. The multiple storylines are fantastic and have made me care for the first time in a pokemon game about my character and those around me. Not to mention with how it approached the legendary cover pokemon, for the first time ever I have felt a bond with a legendary and it actually made sense why I had one in my possession. Other games failed to do that for me. While complaints about polishing are valid and there can always be improvements—I have not had performance issues at all with this running on a very old switch. The developers when making this game took the good elements from SW/SH amongst other games and have put them into a fantastic amalgamation that I hope they continue to replicate in future installments.

It's the most accessible game ever, the ability to explore the world freely is incredible, I love many of the new Pokemon, the new terastalize gimmick is fun, and I still feel there's a lot to explore. If the performance issues weren't here, I'd probably give it a 10"

  ",9,"Pokémon Violet has some of the best written characters with the most compelling storylines the games have ever seen, and an open world so filled with items and Pokémon that it’s easy to lose several hours just exploring and seeing the limits of where you can go. The game does have flaws; it is poorly optimized and a bit buggy, there is a lack of options for clothing (though the character creation itself is probably the most robust in the series so far), and difficulty can weirdly jump around as many players do a bunch of exploring and leveling and then end up steamrolling the first few gyms. The amount of additional levels you can control with each gym badge acquired is also only 5, which leads to some annoyance in not being able to capture or control pokemon of higher levels you may be encountering. Though I am not against some means of preventing the player from grabbing a level 75 garchomp and steamrolling every gym with it, the way they go about it feels too ham-fisted and restrictive.

Overall the game is fantastic with some mostly minor drawbacks that will hopefully be worked on in updates and/or future games, and either way in my experience it has been well worth the price for the amount of time and fun I have gotten out of the game."

  ",7,"This would honestly be the best pokemon game since black and white if based on story alone, however this is a modern pokemon game so it's filled with issues. Mainly performance issues. I won't claim the graphics themselves are bad (for pokemon), but the absolutely abysmal performance is unacceptable. Frequent slowdown, lag, and outright crashes from memory leak is NOT acceptable in the current day in age of games. It really does take away from the experience when you're trying to immerse yourself in the story and the npcs move at 5 frames per second. I am aware you can SOMEWHAT fix these issues by closing and reopening the game to reset memory leak, but I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to make the game playable in the first place. Your average player who does frequent internet discussion about the game won't know that they need to do this in the first place and more than likely experience terrible performance and glitches from memory leak. It's a shame because gameplay wise, this is the most solid modern pokemon game in years. The open world is vast and entirely explorable, right from the moment you get you ride pokemon. Though I do wish they had level scaling and team scaling specifically for the gym leaders, it's still incredibly fun to go off the beaten path and fight something 20 levels above you and win. You can just go straight to the final areas and catch the pseudo legendary of this gen right away if you want. I won't spoil anything, but the ending of the game is the best one we've had in forever. Finally the ability to play online in real time with your friends is a major plus and something we've needed for a while. Despite my thorough criticisms, I still think this is a good but flawed game. I had fun and I think you can too. I'm just warning you that the performance issues are vast and I can only hope they update them out because it's a shame that such a good pokemon game is bogged down with these kind of issues."

  ",10,"I was very hesitant to buy and play because the last 2 gens were not to my liking, but after playing Arceus and loving the open world, I decided to give it a try. Its an amazing game with a solid core and expanded storyline, with lots of collectibles and mini quests around the open world. Some of the environments can be repetitive with endless plains, mountains, oceans, etc. The pokemon act as the detail as they horde up with different species abound. Overall it feels like the exploration of BOTW mashed with a pokemon game, which is what I loved. Completing the pokedex is even made easier as evolved forms of pokemon are readily available so you don't have to spend time grinding for evolutions through level up and can just catch them. The new pokemon are varied and have some unique feature that makes fighting with or against them memorable, and the dense pokedex makes sure there are few ""filler"" pokemon. As much as I would love to have all pokemon, its literally too much for a base game option-wise and I do enjoy the previous gen pokemon getting new forms or variants to make them fresh without recycling. The storyline actually has some interesting moments and some real tragic emotions, although it is tame compared to other games to make a better experience for younger players. The worst part of the game is universally the performance issues and bugs, which range from jittery pokemon, to game crashes (auto save feature is a lifesaver), and even skipping cutscenes. On my playthrough they were reigned in and really didn't impact me at all as lag, objects loading slow and jittery pokemon were barely noticeable as it was fixed within a few seconds. With how infrequent it occurred for me and how little I actually cared about losing a few seconds occasionally, it wasn't that bad. Overall a great game with lots to do and see, and is a must pick for Pokemon fans that loved BOTW. Beware performance issues and watch for patches, but if you're on the fence I recommend just doing it and giving it a try for a few hours, as it can likely be resold for a small loss if you dislike it, but it may also open the door to hours of fun with pokemon."

  ",8,"Pokemon SV is fun. I'm sorry, I know there are performance issues. I know the devs were pushed to an impossible date and were forced to release the game in an unfinished state. I realize these things and I know they made the experience bad for a lot of people, but Pokemon SV is filled with so many good ideas and makes for a very fun and refreshing Pokemon journey. Many have listed its issues so I'm not going to bother retyping them here, we've all seen them; I never had any gamebreaking issues, but its not an acceptable state for a huge game like this to be released in.

However I think SV shows promise of what Pokemon is now and where it is going. There's a lot of creativity and enjoyment in these games, and I know I'll personally look back on them very fondly. I wouldn't recommend them to a non-Pokemon fan in the state they were in at release, but they're filled with awesome character arcs, great story, cool new Pokemon, and fun mechanics. I find myself excited for new mainline Pokemon when I was really dreading new installments after SWSH. This new direction is something I'm very excited for and can't wait to see more of, I just hope we don't slide back into BDSP-type games. Even beyond just pointing a new direction for the games, SV are genuinely fun to play in a ""I can't put this down"" way that I havent gotten for a while, save the first few days after came out. For me, this is the most important thing. I genuinely enjoyed these games, I genuinely want to return to them, and I genuinely fell in love with another Pokemon region. The games are... definitely not in their ideal form and there's no getting around that, but I also love what we were given. I only wish corporate deadlines would allow art to flourish instead of releasing it in an unfinished state."

  ",9,"Pokemon violet is a great upgrade to the pokemon formula. Open world with lots to do. Events to catch pokemon not in the game. Fun story with side quests and lots to explore. Great traversal with pokemon. Pokemon this gen are great especially ones like ceruledge. Now for some negatives.
-Honestly the battling and catching pokemon would have been the best its been in a pokemon **** it wasn't for pokemon legends arceus. Pokemon arceus let's you move around during the fight, catch pokemon on the run, and aim pokeballs. It felt so refreshing in such a great way that it feels a disappointment to go to the slow back and forth. -No spoilers, but a character who is running this group of delinquents is a boring reveal and also a super unlikable and annoying character. I think they tried to make the likable but they are just annoying.
-the graphics are awful. Its time for gamefreak to try a little. They updated the gameplay in a great way but wow this game looks like a xbox360 or ps3 game. Its hard for you to say its because the switch is so underpowered when xenoblade chronicles 3 exists. It looks incredibly old.

Even with these problems, the game has so many positives that make it so fun. -The story isn't as great as arceus but its still great. -The traversal is fun and the events that happen in game are interesting. -The catching gameplay for pokemon is challenging and rewarding. -The tera raids add a way to catch powerful and interesting variations of pokemon. -There are a couple of unique biomes that make it feel like you aren't in one area. -The battling is fun even though its not as good as arceus. -the new pokemon have a lot of interesting combos in regards to types.
-The designs look great.
-Your ""rival"" is a great character that i honestly wish she had her own show.
-The gym leaders are interesting and unique.
-there are so many hours of gameplay in this game.
-Coop is so much fun in the game and you aren't stuck on the exact same screen and area when you join or have someone join your game.

I get why this is rated low by people at the moment because of some glitches and the graphics. Graphics need to be updated badly. I didn't experience any glitches though. And I thoroughly enjoyed the game and it got all my friends to play it and text back and forth with it. I think this is a good base if they add the gameplay elements that they introduced in this game and just add the combat movement of your player and the catching while aiming and throwing from arceus. Also I loved the setting of arceus so it would be great to see different time periods like that. This game was easily a 9/10 and would be a 10/10 but I think arceus was technically a bit better gameplay wise. But arceus really needed pokemon badges so had no badges so it felt like something was missing so its also a 9/10. But I think in the future please keep making games like this and arceus but just update the graphics please. It really looks worse than a phone game its really insane how low graphics some things are."

  ",8,"Genuinely crackheaded that there are this many negative reviews, even taking into consideration the very worst of the performance issues and graphics. The strengths of this game ridiculously outweigh its weaknesses.

////

+ Narratively, all previous mainline games don't even come close. Though they suffer from some repetition, likely because of the open world format, the three storylines are solid, intriguing and surprisingly emotional, and they converge into a beautiful, intense finale. Few people seem to talk about it but the inclusion of Pokemon as proper *characters* adds a lot as well, and is honestly long overdue.

+ Same can be said about the soundtrack; East Province, battle against Arven, battle against ""Turo/Sada"", are all easily some of the best and most memorable works in the entire series. Clear motifs throughout assist the narrative well. Adaptive music is always welcome.

+ The Pokemon designs and concepts are mostly strong. Regional forms and evolutions return and are all pretty much solid. Some new designs stand out as wasted potential (Baxcalibur) or somewhat out of place in execution.

+ The Tera system is one of the better ""gimmicks"" and adds neat complexity to battles.

+ Larry.

////

- Everything about the graphics and performance has already been said, and they're pretty inexcusable given the success of this franchise. Personally, I definitely had problems-- none of them were game-breaking, but some took away immersion.

- The open world works, but is kind of dull. Some areas could be condensed.

- A lack of customization options for clothing is super disappointing. SwSh is a weaker game but its level of customization was ideal.

- Scaling difficulty should be an option in the future, especially for an open world game executed like this.

This game is absolutely the right direction for the series and Gamefreak should continue to expand and improve upon what makes this game work."

The first ‘truely open-world’ Pokémon game delivers on the expectation. Enjoyable world traversal, interesting locales to explore and unique Pokémon to find makes the Paldea region a joy to simply wander.

For the first time in a while, GameFreak has also stepped up its character writing. Each of the prominent characters are a treat to deal with, Arven in particular, and Nemona is one of the first ‘Rival’ characters in some time to feel like a genuine rival to the player.

Despite these excellent improvements to the series, Violet is not without some significant issues holding it back. Game slow-down is a major flaw in the Generation 9 experience, noticed in many areas across the game, sometimes to extreme degrees, quickly breaking immersion and gameflow.
The game’s ‘Tera Raid Battles’ also suffer serious desync issues that result in buggy fights, confusion in what is happening and even serious glitches, such as being forced to sit on a white screen for up to a minute while battle sounds continue to play in the background.

Pokémon Violet is 100% a step in the right direction for the Pokémon franchise, but its lack of polish is worrying as it seems to be becoming a bit of a norm.
Had Violet been a polished experience on launch, it may have been lauded as the one of the best Pokémon games in a decade…"

With an extensive history spanning over 9 generations, and now over a thousand critters to choose from, it simply has an inherent advantage no other game has due to its history. That being said, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are not good games.

Now, I'm sure most everyone is expecting me to bash the game for being a buggy, unfinished train wreck. No. I honestly don't care about that, and I'm someone who likes buggy games. My issue with Scarlet and Violet is that I simply don't find them that fun. The world feels barren, devoid of life, like it was just auto-generated and key towns were placed wherever. There never feels like there's a lot to do even though you have so many objectives. The only challenging part of the game for me was when I decided to intentionally take on a gym way above my level. Other than that, every single challenge was easy. The creature designs feel like they've also taken a hit for me, and I barely managed to **** together a full team for this game.

Pokémon Violet's open-world map is heterogeneous, both visually and structurally, and offers a seamless exploration with great emphasis on layered vertical progression, rich of treasure to encourage exploration, progressively expanded through mobility upgrades. Even so, the world feels disappointingly dull at its core, due to Pokémon almost never interacting with each other or the environment. on top of their slow, passive reactions to the player's presence. Furthermore, most of the treasure throughout the region of Paldea is redundant or functionally useless, leaving only the discovery of the new Pokémon species to act as the main incentive for exploration, but they're not enough to carry the entire journey. The new open-world progression allows players to tackle the various challenges in any order, but the lack of level scaling virtually strips the player from any real agency lest they'll retroactively make the other challenges terribly easy, which happens anyway since the game's difficulty offers no excitement whatsoever outside from venturing dangerous areas. The game tries to add flavor to its fights through the Terastalization mechanic, which adds a decent twist to strategies, and to add flavor to its trials with various minigames, but these are excruciatingly, embarassingly simplistic. Customization received a massive downgrade, with a lot less clothing options. The story is bland and offers very little substance, that is until the last few hours, when it haphazardly unveils its true potential and interesting concepts in a rush."

The map is not fully accessible from the beginning unless you use glitches to reach later areas. Gym leaders' pokémon have fixed levels, that means if you like exploring different areas and catching pokémon before tackling gym challenges, you better be prepared to be greatly over-leveled. This takes away the feeling of ""choose your own route"" and trivializes any encounter as your team will most likely be way more powerful than your opponent's.
The story had some good points, but the awful performance of the game, the constant glitches and the empty cities, terrible npc model animations and constant dips in framerate overshadow every good aspect that the game might have had. As a life-long fan of the franchise, this is definitely a step back."

If you're reading review then you probably already know the development quality is terrible. But as a game dev myself I can also tell you this: no future patch will be able to fix this game. So don't keep your hope up.

The fandom might be telling you Game Freaks will fix it in later patches. That won't happen. This game was made by amateurs, probably half the team are interns they hired to fill in the vacant spots. The only way to properly fix this game is to remake it from the beginning, which won't happen.

Frame rate spike, jerky animations, camera running underground, 3 meters pokemon view distance. These things will never be fixed. So wait for next pokemon game (and don't pre-order this time) or replay classic version or find another monster-taming game. Just don't buy this."

I noticed that Game Freak released a ""day 0"" update, so I got my game copy up to date... The suspicious thing here is that Game Freak recognized that the game may not be ended with the ""naked"" cartridge without the 1.0.1 update. What they actually were recognizing was that they ran out of time, so that they didn't finish the game at flashing cartriges milestone.
What I experienced at the really first hours playing Scarlet was that the game feels so laggy. Every time I open Pokedex the game takes 1 second or so with a kind of transition of laggy black screen, also when opening the Pokémon storage box.

Saying this about this game is very painful for me. I was expecting this game so much. And also have to say that the historiy, the enviroment and everything related to the game (without the technical aspects) is extraordinary. Brilliant. The score would have been much higher in my case just if Game Freak didn't just remove the Quality Assessment phase in their development.

They have published an update which fixes some of the problems. The game is 9/10 for me (not considering technical issues)."

Mais ces jeux souffre d'un manque de travail cruel sur la technique, qui pénalise l'expérience de jeu. Des textures horribles, des ralentissements et bugs, des choses évitables mais qui l'ont pas été.

Et c'est dommage car derrière, les jeux offre un bon open-world qui pousse à l'exploration. Un monde ouvert qui est généreux en objet, en Pokémon et en environnement. Un jeu qui offre également plusieurs quêtes intéressante, apportant parfois des nouveautés pour la série principale. Et qui se fini sur une quête très narrative qui nous transport dans une ambiance originale pour la licence. Le tout sur une bande sonore exceptionnelle et avec l'utilisation intéressante de la téracrystallisation.

Mais on peut également noté que la personnalisation est certes bien amélioré mais déçoit sur certain aspect. Que la difficulté non basé sur le joueur facile l'expérience de jeu. Et que les cinématiques manque de doublage pour qu'elles soient plus impactante.

En clair, Pokémon Écarlate / Violet sont de très bon jeu, qui propose un vrai pas en avant pour la licence Pokémon avec un bon open-world, mais c'est aussi des jeux qui souffre de leurs techniques.

I do want to eventually go back and finish them, but I struggled to maintain focus. Pokemon Violet (and Scarlet are riddled with graphical glitches, bugs, and frustrating mechanics, however the core of the gameplay, story, and characters kept me there for the entire game. Pokemon riding my ass while battling something else and immediately getting me caught in unwanted battles was real frustrating. The ""Let's Go"" feature is pretty rough around the edges. Feeling unresponsive at times. The pop in is really bad, and frame drops sometimes make me want to turn the game off with how bad it can get. But that was only twice and never did I get a crash or bug that broke my game. To be honest it didnt sour my experience much because I was just happy that the core game was good. Great even. The new Pokemon are wonderful, the story is the best in the series in my opinion. The region is stellar (when it doesnt chug at 10 frames per second with pop in and such) but that didnt really kill my excitement. I felt like a kid again. I think people are too cynical about performance. This felt like a real Pokemon game and I hope with patches and bug fixes that it will just continue to get better with time and DLC. When the problems get fixed I can easily see this as a 9/10, but for now 7/10 is my score."

I'm not going to talk about the countless glitches, bugs, performance issues because I'm sure they are going to get fixed.

Lets address the Elephant in the room, the graphics, the graphics even for a switch game are really bad and it's not like the switch couldn't handle better graphics, SMT, Monster Hunter, Zelda and even Pokemon Lets Go are graphically way more impressive and that's what Pokemon should at least look like.

The new story ,,paths'' are all nice and bring something new to Pokemon, but they are not executed perfectly well.

Also while the game has cut scenes, they are in silence, they should have at least voice actors for the cut scenes.

Archiving major accomplishments like beating the Pokemon League are not celebrate like in other games and is basically nothing special in this game.

The new Pokemon's are all nice and I like the new Forms of certain Pokemon's.

The new Tera transformations dosnt't look really nice and while it bring something to the competitive multiplayer, they don't bring anything to the main game.

Also new mechanics like ,,auto-battles'' don't really work well, the path finding of your Pokemon screws up a lot.

If we are also going to talk about the new open world, there is basically nothing to explore or see, it's just a empty world.

Another thing I didn't like was you can't go in every building, you can't talk to every NPC and trainer battles are optional.

Visual customization of your own character was cut in content a lot in comparison to sword and shield.

I still had fun exploring the new Pokemon and I did like the Zone Zero area in the game, so that's why I still give the game a decent rating.

Game Freak should take some time off there normal release schedule and really work on a good Pokemon Game."

to start with, no the customization is NOT expanded upon, sword and shield had far better clothing options, and hair options.

there is no open capture system like in Arceus, your forced to run up and enter combat every time you want to catch a Pokémon

there are very little to no indoor areas, making it feel like your just walking around an all natural commune.

First of all: I've played all 3 paths and I have finished the Zone Zero Storyline, caught about 100 Pokemon and explored the world for the most part. So I think I gave the game a fair Chance before writing this review.

Pros:
-Cool Rirval
-Good new Pokemon and evolutions to prior ones
-Nice concept of 3 Paths/Storys to follow
-Mostly decent graphics
-I havent encountered any gamebreaking bugs
-the 3 main storys are decent for a pokemon game (but badly told due to the badly thought out Open World and the limitations that came with it)
-moving around on your mount is fun when you got all upgrades

Cons:
-Open World is not level scaled
-Open Wolrd is at times bland and empty
-There's nothing to gather for crafting in the Open World, only Potions, Balls and X-Items (which I can just buy), So why would i go out of my way to explore? There are not Dungeons either
-The Story cutscenes are repetitive and always play in the same locations due to Open World limitations, which takes all liberty away.
-Gyms are all the same texture
-Towns are uninspired and boring, i cant name a single one after finishing the game
-there are a grand total of 0 NPC quests which would allow for emotional binding with the world and its inhabitants
-Gym trials are uninspired at best and boring at its worst
-Every Gym leader except Iono is forgettable
-Story Cutscenes are barebones and feature no memorable interactions like pokemon battles
-If you don't follow the intended order of Gyms the game is either too hard (levels are too high) or too easy (if you grind to beat the high level gym) afterwards. The difficulty is fine if you follow the intended path, so why is it fully Open World again if you don't actually have a choice?
-The battles are awfully slow. Why is there a delay after every action? It could be so much snappier
-Why are there so many trainers in the open world that only have one pokemon? Where's the difference between that and a random encounter? It just takes 3x as long to battle them so I started avoiding them at a certain point in the game
-Team Star Bases and trials are boring and repetitive. They're literally the same every time. They almost feel like an afterthought and very rushed
-The Pokemon league was the most disappointing climax in the whole game. Whos idea was it to make it literally just two boring rooms, one being out of minecraft diamond blocks? There was no reason in making this so boring (unlike the caves or gyms who had to be the same due to interchangeable story cutscenes)
-The Elite 4 are boring and have zero character (but I think that is like this in every pokemon game, at least they are present outside their League-Rooms, but I too wouldn't want to stay in that depressing room all day long)
-The last story arc is literally just a walking-sim with your new friends...
-Most of the story of the last arc is just dumped on you during a boring elevator ride
-Arven is the only one who got a decent and meaningful character development (and even that is barebones)
-The last story arc is rushed, there is no sense of urgency and no real dilemma since it's clear what to do and it's over after at max 1,5h depending on performance

So overall I would rate this game a 4/10 and this is with not even mentioning the common performance issues since i think most people are focusing too much on them when they don't say much about the game at all. I tried to focus only on the game itself and it was ultimately not a good game. I can see most people have fun on a surface level with the core-pokemon mechanics like battles and gyms and some well working additions like the mount. But overall I don't think this offering enough to call S/V a good, replayable game."

On a technical level the frame-rate, character animation, and general graphics are poor enough as to be unacceptable. 95% of buildings cannot be entered and an equally poor number of NPCs can be interacted with. It looks and plays like an alpha. The amount gameplay is skeletal. No post game to speak of, huge empty zones, a worthless new gimmick, trainers rarely have more than two Pokemon, the gym challenges are creatively bankrupt, and Team Star content consists of slow, stiff animations and a bizarre mini-game in which you just repeatedly press the right bumper until your Pokemon defeat enough opposing Pokemon by bump into them.

The game can be fun for those first few hours of exploring a new Pokemon game, just like it always is, but expect your enjoyment to run dry after a few days. If you can borrow a friend's copy give it a try and have what fun you can. If the only way you can play it is to buy it I highly suggest you give Pokemon Violet a pass."

Can’t say I’ve encountered any major glitches, mostly just slowdown/frame rate stuff. I honestly have been loving my experience but I do think Pokémon deserves more time and care. They have such an amazing history of groundbreaking games and this one just seems to be **** by in some places. That being said, the characters, story, music and Pokémon are all sweet as, the open world is fun to traverse too!"

  ",8,"Pokémon Violet is the culmination of everything GameFreak had been working towards with Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Starting from the most obvious, performance is far from optimal. Sadly it is not the wonderous landscape and smooth adventure that we wanted it to be. Points have to be docked for that. What Pokémon Violet does well however, is just about everything else it has to offer! It is an wide open adventure that for the first time, you can take at your own pace! There is no required direction, and this Pokémon region is truly yours to explore. The new battle systems are not only wonderful for ease of use, but are also extremely enjoyable. Not to mention for the first time ever in a Nintendo game, I can honestly say that the online works exactly as intended. It's simple, its fast, and there is no difficulty in connection to other players for adventures and raids. This is one of the most fun Pokémon games to play, and moving forward we can return to ones that are enjoyable visually as well."

  ",9,"Damn the angry crowd is review bombing this game with their emotion and not actually giving some useful and fair review, which definitely not deserved. Yeah, sure its got lot of bugs, and I mean A LOT of bugs, but its not like Cyberpunk 2077 first day where there a lot of game breaking bugs. People tend to ignore the game's core that are beside graphics which is the gameplay, the story, the innovation and the music when they are enraged, which will gave an incorrect review. So, to player who plans to read the review before buying the games, make sure the review is actually have some points in it and not something that just write by people who just try to review bomb it, positive and negative review. Alright, time to get to the main points.

With the 4 points I mention above, let's start with 1) The Gameplay:
The gameplay adapts some mechanics from Pokémon Legends: Arceus like backstabbing (yes, using your Pokémon's pokeball) and giving you a first strike advantage. Your riding Pokémon which depends on which version you purchased (in this case Miraidon) also got new overworld ability like Sprinting, Swimming and etc. which is also adapts from PL:A. This game is also the first Pokémon game to feature full-open world, with loading time only occurred on cutscenes loading and entering and leaving buildings. The level scaling, I can't defend this one, they have Nemona level scaling with your current gym badge and your champion status, but they can't level scale the gym and other wild Pokémon, but I still got a good laugh when my level 10 Quaxly suddenly battling a level 35 trainer, and you know what happen next, blacked out, lost some of my Pokédollars and back to Pokécenter. Speak of Pokécenter, this new Pokécenter absolutely fit the open world style gameplay. Need to heal, found a Pokécenter, heal up, go back to adventure, repeat. Simple and quick, no loading time except maybe the healing animation, which is also quicker than past games. And now, the new mechanic: Terastellize. By default, every wild Pokémon's Tera type is by their original's type, if it have two original type, its one of those as Tera type. There one exception for wild pokémon, there some Pokémon sparkling in the wild, and when you battling them, they will immediately Terastellize, which the Tera type is often not the same with their original type. You can also change your Pokémon's Tera type by defeating the Medali City Gym first, so you can talk to the cook and change your Pokémon's Tera type with 50 Tera Shards, which can found in the wild and as a Raid Rewards. Speaking of raid, it is time to talk about the Tera Raid. Some of the things in Tera Raid is adapts from SW/SH's Dynamax Raid, like the four players to raid and the Tera Shield. Now lets talk about new things in Tera Raid, you have 3 different Cheers skill and can only use 3 times combined in a Tera Raid, ""Go All Out!"" raise you and other player's ATK and SP ATK, ""Hang Touch"" raise you and other player's DEF and SP DEF and ""Heal Up"" heal you and other player's Pokémon;s HP and status condition. So carefully plan your cheers skill to help you and your team to win the Raid. Tera Raid use time now and not the Dynamax Raid's 4 fainting counts. And trust me, you will have enough time to win the raid even if there Pokémon get fainted a lot, not saying 7 stars Tera Raids though, you need a good team for that. Speaking of overworld multiplayer, I cant say anything about it because I don't have friends (Cry in the background), so lets move to the next points.

2)The Story
I'm going to be honest, this might be the best story alongside B/W's Story. I can't said anything here since its will be count as spoiler, but trust me, the story is very freaking good. My recommend steps to play the 3 paths is: Path to Legends => Victory Roads > Starfall Street.

3)The Innovation:
The ""Let's Go"" feature. Its a very good feature when you just want to exp grinds, since its save a lot of time to battle and wait for all the animation to finish, and its also wont beat the Shiny Pokémon so don't worry accidently kill a Shiny Pokémon with this feature. Now on to the things that is not new gaming innovation, but more of a Pokémon franchise's innovation, the full-open world which I mention above, so I won't talk about it again. The Riding Pokémon that is more improved version from PL:A, just one Pokémon and you can explore the entire maps (of course you need unlock the ability first which is in Path of Legend).

4)The Music:
Good ol Game Freak, still making banging music, and now with the help of Toby Fox, the creator of the popular indie games: Undertale and Deltarune. You will enjoy the music in this game.

Conclusion, the games will be, if not, the best Pokémon games if it without the bug that everybody angry for. So I recommend to play this games despite everybody being angry about the bugs, because underneath the bugs, its a gems. (I'm reaching text limit so no picnic part)"

Not the Gym Leader Battles but Battles against the The Team Star Leaders or like the Battle against the Academy Director. Some Trainer can One shot you with ease. The 3 Main Storys are a welcomed change, The Bullying-Topic in the Team Star Story had a good Message in it. The Character Designs, Dialogues and the new Team (Team Star) are way more ""normal"" so you wont have many Cringe-Situations at all and especially no annoying Characters like you had a Ton of in Sword/Shield.

This game has two major the first problem is that it took to much from Breath of the Wild you can do almost any of the games story (Gyms, Team Star, Titans) in any order which hurts the story and the second problem is with the switch itself the switch just isn't powerful enough to properly handle what game freak is trying to do with the games and there are other pokemon games on the console that prove the switch is partially at fault for the issues

  ",4,"I really wanted to give this game a better grade, it was incredibly fun, I became addicted to the game for 4 days until I finished it. However, it has serious issues in the whole structure which were too impactful to ignore. Therefore, just to clarify, this review and grade do not exactly reflect my real experience, bc I'm considering the whole production context (pokemon is the **** most expensive intelectual property in history) and comparisons with other games in the market. Also, I'm taking from a perspective played of a franchise fan who played all games since diamond/pearl (except lets go pikachu/eevee, BD/SP and Legends Arceus).

1. Grafics/performance 1/10 - I really don't know how the **** this game was let to be launched like that but even for pokémon paterns this game is surprisingly broken. It really impact the player's experience in a way that in the beginning of the game I really wanted to take a refund due to this issue. It's almost impossible to play at 30 fps, thats **** ridiculous, and also the background grafics are at the same level of a ps1 game, without exaggerations, which contrast with the main character's grafics that are far better.

2. Story 7/10 - It really is the best pokemon game in terms of story, however it still is far worse and non-sense compared to other games in the market and also nintendo ones, just as zelda. Although the character's are far more engaging and relatable which is a strong point of this game.

3. Gameplay 7/10 - I don't have much to talk about this segment, it is better and more fun than usual because it's a open world game. The amount of things to do in the game is huge and it really improve the experience but is not enough to overshadow the issues of the game.

There are much more things to say but I don't really know if they are as important as the other points. Although I would like to enlighten a problem across all the pokemon franchise, WHERE THE **** ARE THE VOICE ACTORS, it is unacceptable that the multi-billionaire pokemon company can't give the budget necessary to hire some voice actors, the game 'd be so much better, I think I'd even cry in some scenes, like arven with his dog or the last ones of operation starfall, if there were some dubbling."

  ",5,"The gameplay and story is not enough to save the absolutely horrid graphics and performance. The overworld does have it's moments of greatness, in particular the bamboo forest and Socarrat Trail, however the bad outweighs this. The zones are mostly bland and scarce of features, not helped by the graphics. This is doubly true for the cities, which almost always feel empty and tiny at the same time. Even if you wanted to enjoy the scenery of this game, it's still a task, due to the abominable performance issues. On a vanilla Nintendo Switch, this game lags constantly while out in the open world.
Playing through the game was actually rather enjoyable. The variety of Pokemon you could see in the open world was unexpectedly vast, and made me feel like I had a lot of options for building my team. It also made me want to explore around in hopes of seeing something I really wanted to use. This exploration aspect was emphasized in a really great way through the riding Pokemon (either Miraidon or Koraidon respectively). You would unlock new travel features each time you defeated a Titan Pokemon, which sort of created a positive feedback loop. However, these riding Pokemon are ruined by bugs. I fell through the ground not once, but twice while riding Miraidon. There was also a lot of various ""jank"" I encountered. It's extremely disappointing that this game was sold in a state like this. On another note, this game is actually very different from it's predecessors in terms of how battles are handled. There are basically no compulsory trainer battles in the open world, which I think is fine, however I would've have minded if there was still LoS encounters. There are alternative ways of leveling up your Pokemon, (for me) primarily the Tera Raids. Each time you defeat a Tera Raid, you get a sizeable loot drop, which contains Exp. Candies. This makes it to where you can use Tera Raids as a primary means to level up your Pokemon, which I really liked.
I really liked the story and characters. Your rival, Nemona, is not a new trainer like you are, and is instead a champion-ranked trainer. She is somebody that is obsessed with battling, and wants to have you get strong enough to challenge her at her full strength. In order to do this, she raises a new team of Pokemon to challenge you as you go along your journey. Overall, her character was surprisingly enjoyable, considering how unenjoyable the rivals have been in previous games. Arven, another character, was also likeable. Throughout the story, you assist him in defeating Titan Pokemon and getting the Herba Mystica they keep guard of in their dens. Arven's motivation for getting these herbs is that his Pokemon, Mabosstiff, is ill, and he had exhausted all other options for curing him. I really liked this storyline in particular. The last aspect of the story is Team Star. It's hard to go into information about this one without spoiling information that is slowly fed to you, but I liked the leaders of Team Star. Overall, the story and characters were a huge step from the previous couple generations.
The game after beating the story is scarce. You basically just rematch all the gym leaders and take part in a school tournament. Many players were disappointed in the lack of a Battle Tower, and I agree with them. It seems incomplete, however I expect them to >sell< DLC to actually finish the content, which I am really not happy about.
This game is good, however it's an ugly, buggy mess, and not in a way that they'll actually get around to fixing. I enjoyed it, but I cannot reasonably give it anything higher than a 5/10."

Honestly a disappointment with the company, this game is not even worth half of its value, and here I leave my note of repudiation and I hope that things will improve in the future, and pokemon company will consider our complaints and fulfill our request."

However, the graphics optimization was hard to see with my eyes open. Frame drops were occurring almost every moment, and screen stuttering, lagging, and immersion greatly disrupted my gameplay. It was unpleasantly severe, especially in rainy or polygonal sea fields. It felt like I was playing an online game with a very bad internet connection. They shouldn't have released the game like this.

To sum up, out of all the Pokémon games they've ever made, it was so fun and interesting that no doubt, I would call it a ""masterpiece"" in terms of story, game ability, and convenience. That's why I was even more angry and sad that the other parts were ****"

I'm sorry, but what other Pokémon game has launched in a completely broken state with no follow-up patch or even an apology from Game Freak?

I've played every game in the Pokémon series since I was a child. But now I'm an adult, and these games cost over $60. Decent performance (especially given how mediocre the graphics are) is the BARE MINIMUM. I'm glad that some of you are able to look past the fact that you were ripped off because of your fandom for the series, but this is absurd. The Switch hardware is being scapegoated for the issues, even though countless titles prove that the Switch is capable of running massive open world games, and running them well.

You mean to tell me that I can play Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Breath of the Wild on this console, but an open world Pokemon game with mobile quality graphics simply can't hack it? Nonsense. I'd be willing to give Game Freak the benefit of the doubt if they came out with a statement, an apology, or if they promised a future patch to optimize some of the problems. But nothing. Radio silence. I didn't preorder this game with the hope that it would be playable six months from now.

This is a prime example of the worst trend in modern gaming: Releasing broken, beta builds of games at full price, and expecting the consumer to just accept it."

Instead, I'll summarize:

Pokemon Violet (and Scarlet) are fun games, even beyond just ""it's Pokemon."" I'm not an open world fan, but the open world worked... at least when the game worked, that is. The writing is among the top of the series, not that this is a massive compliment considering the Pokemon games aren't known for spectacular storytelling.

But the problems with the game are significant - from removal of quality of life features and customization at the minor end, to the massive framerate issues, bugs and glitches, and overall lack of polish on so much of the game. A released game can't be called good if it's not finished, and that's what this game feels like. It needed more time, and whoever is behind the rushed scheduling - likely a higher up at GameFreak, The Pokemon Company, and/or Nintendo - hopefully will at least have to acknowledge that with the negative feedback from players. Sadly, the sales mean that's not likely - but for the miniscule amount it's worth, this game was my attempt to see if getting back into buying the games was worth it, and I don't plan to buy any more mainline Pokemon games moving forward without significant change."

Cutting the storyline in three is probably one of the best decisions gamefreak couldve done for the narrative, and the story overall is probably the best since bw2, even managing to include emotional moments and a plotwist i did not see coming. Almost all of the new pokemon look amazing, alongside with most of the new characters being really enjoyable and the music consists once again only of absolute hits.

The only other negative is that the camera angles could be a little better in certain cases and the controls could feel a little bit more fluid. All of these negatives CAN be fixed with time.

Let me start by saying that I have given a 10, when I might have given a 9, because I feel that the game should have some compensation against the really unfair and highly critical reviews which mainly highlight the same negatives which I have.

I have played pokemon since the beginning. I have followed the journey of every version of this game, and I need you to know a few things about what sets this game apart from its predecessors.

I am going to skim over the usual stuff, which relates to the game's openness and how it brings a fully realised interactive 3D environment. This is good, but it is not what sets the game apart.

What makes this a GREAT game, is the story and character development, the likes of which we have never seen so well developed in previous pokemon games. With the exception of some slightly tedious cut-scenes, Pokemon Violet and Scarlet have really compelling characters and pokemon, and the lore building is absolutely night and day different than we're used to. Let me say, without spoiling anything, that finding out more about Arven's father, Professor Truro and Area Zero was a storyteller's delight. I am absolutely thrilled to see pokemon taking a grittier tone with its storytelling which doesn't shy away from difficult themes such as loss, illness, bullying, friendship, and growing up. To see such richness in character development and a serious and compelling story with so many themes which are really pertinent to what it means to be a human being, this was a treat that I didn't expect and propels this version towards the front of the line as one of the best pokemon games of ALL the series.

Yes, bugs, yes, glitches, but these are minor flaws when you can see genuine heart, soul, and life in a long-lived franchise. This alone makes Pokemon Violet and Scarlet and experience to remember. If you love story driven games, you'll easily love this, and with the same tried and tested pokemon frame-work that made it the name it is today? What are you waiting for? Dive in!"

Scarlet and Violet are no exception to this opinion. If anything, the issues presented this time around are WORSE than what people criticised with Arceus' arrival at the start of the same year.

Game Freak are not only too small a team to be expected to deliver the content asked of them, but their release schedule is far too crammed to deliver the quality of games expected of what should be the slickest, most polished looking gaming franchise there is out there.

From a technical point of view, the game is an insult to the buyers. The world looks like a mobile game (which is certainly due to the hardware), there are heavy frame drops, the camera likes to fall through the floor. Small things are also unfortunately lazily implemented, such as status changes. Sleeping Pokemon no longer close their eyes like in Sword/Shield. On the world map, however, they do so when they are asleep. Sloppy.
There is little customization for the player.
The areas are quite dead. NPCs function like puppets without a soul. But that's always been the case with Pokemon, unfortunately.

On the positive side - the Pokemon themselves are cool (except for some sloppy solutions like the status changes). Catching them is fun thanks to the new implementation, because it's faster.

All in all, it's a game that excites me because of the technology. Still, I can't put it down. Is it worth the price? No. But for under $50, you can definitely pick it up."

The best aspect of this game is the mixture of free open world exploration with the classic Pokemon formula, but even that isn't perfect. Gym battles strongly encourage the player to challenge the gym in a set order, and the three stories consist of battling, battling, and battling, with very few changes to make each story stand on its own, making the choice to focus on certain paths less engaging. Like most Pokemon games, this one introduces new features, but also lacks ones that made older titles appealing. Most new Pokemon are cool, the soundtrack is catchy, and QOL upgrades enhance the open world exploration, but for all good features, there's several aspects of the game that make it hard to enjoy these. The game looks more or less better than the previous title, Pokemon Legends Arceus, but at the cost of the framerate costantly chugging and Pokemon constantly popping up frustratingly clise to the player. Another downgrade from Pokemon Legends is the lack of any ability to catch Pokemon without battling. One would think Legends style catching would be a priority to make the open world experience more convinient, but the feature is unfortunately absent. As of writing this post, I have around 50 hours clicked into the game, with the three stories close to completion, but I don't find myself playing the game as much since the cons of the game are starting to wear me down. If Pokemon Scarlet and Violet get performance patches that fix various issues in a reasonable amount of time, I would love to return to review this game with a more positive outlook, but if these issues remain unaddressed, I can't see myself return to this game, or even the series if The Pokemon Company sweeps these issues under the rug and start development on another rushed game.

One small game play bone I still have to pick with Gamefreak: I will never get used to the damn Exp share… why can‘t I grind each Pokemon individually if I want to???

But besides that: Pokemon looks better than it ever has (even with the performance issues)! And it’s also more fun than it has been in a long time. Don’t listen to people who haven’t bothered to actually play this game!

  ",0,"A little foreword:
I grew up with Pokémon and always bought games on release. PLA was a masterpiece in my eyes as it brought fresh new mechanics and a new way to experience Pokémon. Of course I was delighted when I saw Scarlet and Violet being announced and being open world. This must have been a dream come true. So fast forward to a bad marketing company, the games content leaking early and finally the game releasing.

Now, I was never the person to blatantly insult a game despite bad graphics and low frame rates but god damn. This is just something else. I played it for 8+ hours and it really saddens me seeing my favorite franchise ending up in such a state. The performance issues were so bad that we were literally thinking that my switch was broken. We tried it on my girlfriend's for about 2 hours just to see that it is in fact the game. Additionally information has come out that there is a memory leak in the game. As a long time software developer myself I was stunned to see that a game gets shipped / released without proper testing. I knew that this was common for triple A studios such as CD Project Red with Cyberpunk but as a first party developer of Nintendo this might be the worst release of a Nintendo exclusive title. I already set the bar low when it comes to Game Freak but this time they need to sit down and reflect and maybe consider expanding or handing the Mainline games to someone that actually cares. I will ask for a refund and will not be part of the problem anymore. And no I won't buy it again after they fixed it. I am done."

The games got lots of great style and personality, great story and characters, nice gameplay mechanics aside from the absence of the poke ball free throw seen in the last game this year. Which is a bit sad but isn't that big of a deal, and the selfie mechanic is a very charming feature to immerse players. Yes, a small patch is needed for the reported technical issues but that's up to Game Freak. I've got four more badges to collect so I'm only halfway through the game at the moment but hey, I heard about this unfair hatred and criticism towards the game and game freak and just wanted to put my positive opinion out here, a shame it's still at a red 3.4 at the moment, deserves at least a 7.5.

After about 30 hours of play, over 300 Pokemon caught and the end of the story, I can only say ... I am totally happy that I played this game. The storylines were consistently good and fun, the animations and videos were great, and the battles and dialogue were amazing.
For the first time in a Pokemon game, you finally had the feeling that the character you're playing is evolving and growing up. Yes, you even finally had the feeling that the playable character makes friends and these became more and more solidified over the course of the game. That's something I've wanted in a Pokemon game for a long time. The huge open world and the freedom you have there rounded out the whole thing. I can very well overlook small points of criticism, such as the rarely occurring FPS drops, as these did not affect the gameplay at all.
I simply cannot confirm that this is an unfinished game, as many write. I don't know where the **** comes from, but from me the game gets a very clear thumbs up. Thanks for that!"

  ",2,"I need to start off by saying my favourite video games of all time are Pokemon games. Pokemon Red and Blue (1998) were the first video games I ever owned. I think Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen (2004), alongside Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver (2009) are the best Pokemon games I have ever played.

It pains me to say this, but I do not think Nintendo is capable of making a good Pokemon game anymore.

Since the release of Pokemon Black and White (2010), Pokemon X and Y (2013), and Pokemon Sun and Moon (2016) the Pokemon franchise has been heading on a downward trend. These games when compared to their predecessors and contemporaries in the industry are lackluster, medicore products, seemingly selling their games based purely off of nostalgia.

Pokemon GO (2016), despite the popularity is the worst Pokemon game I have ever played.

The greed at Nintendo has led them to exploit their fanbase by releasing rushed and poorly designed games with massive technical issues.

I was extremely hopeful when the Nintendo Switch came out and I anticipated finally receiving a fun and beautiful new open world Pokemon game, similar to other fun, new, and beautiful Nintendo properties for the Switch. (You know the ones I'm talking about. The games that don't have 3.4 ratings on Metacritic.) But unfortunately the Pokemon games for Nintendo Switch, Pokemon Lets Go Eevee and Let's Go Pickachu (2018), Pokemon Sword and Shield (2019), and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet (2022) have been terrible games. These games are incomplete and far less fun than previous Pokemon iterations. I would NEVER recommend these Pokemon games on the Switch to anyone. I have never been more disappointed in a game then with Pokemon Sword and Shield, and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet turned out to be FAR MORE DISAPPOINTING.

The new Pokemon games are not 'triple A' titles, they are rushed, glitchy, poorly designed, graphically terrible monstrosities that Nintendo and GameFreak should be ashamed to ask full price for.

Because of these reasons, and the downward trend of Pokemon games over the past THIRTEEN YEARS, I feel as though Nintendo has exploited me enough, and I will not be buying anymore Pokemon games for the Switch.

I cannot believe a culture that is deeply concerned with shame would release such a disgraceful, imperfect product and then charge full price knowing very well that product is unfinished.

This comes across to me as though the people releasing Pokemon games, and the CEO's in charge have no shame.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the fastest selling Nintendo games (within the first three days of sales). However, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have been so highly criticized for the technical issues that it seems Nintendo is now issuing refunds in response.

The fastest selling Pokemon games are being issued refunds for technical issues.

Think about that. That is shockingly unacceptable.

There will be no change in the culture at Pokemon until fans start letting Nintendo know exactly how they feel, I am protesting by not buying anymore Pokemon games. Nintendo can also have this review."

The open world works perfectly and encourages exploration. The newly added pokemons feel unique and better designed than the past few generations. The 3 stories are very different to what we usually get from a pokemon game and the characters feel human and are way more likeable than the usually very annoying characters we get. This is in lot of way the pokemon game I always hoped for.

But the technical issues are present and really aren't excusable. The games desperatly needs more polish and I hope a patch comes out as soon as possible. If these issues are fixed and the game gets expanded on though good DLC content it might redeem itself.

With this game and the recent Legends Arceus GameFreak / TPC have proven they can make ambitious titles and that gives me hope for future games. But they absolutely need to give more time to developers or hire more to be able to deliver a finished product."

There's almost nothing redeeming about this miserable experience, the game is fantastically simple with repetitive grinding to get anywhere and poor level scaling across the world. You have very little agency in how you play; my team of 6 lechonks couldn't even beat the tutorial fights, I feel it's very heavy on you learning them meta. There are points where you get dialogue choices, but these never matter as even if you tell the director you don't like his paper maché school or reject the over-friendly girl's advances, you're still forced to go along with it. All of that is ignoring the elephant in the pokéball: the horrendous visuals and performance. I fully expect this game to win the ""Innovation in Accessibility"" category at the Game Awards this year as Game Freak have pulled off something truly remarkable with this game: it's the first that's actually more enjoyable if you're blind. The overall polish and feel of the game is appalling and easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Even very old 3D games have better rendering distances than this, and often look better since they were pushing the limits back then. This ""game"" was very clearly made by an incredibly passionless team on a deadline and no regard for customer satisfaction. It's hard to imagine how the game could be in a technically worse state than this without literally not starting up. Nintendo and Gamefreak should be ashamed of this miserable showing, almost six years after Nintendo themselves put out much more competent games on the same hardware. The correct thing to do would be issuing a full recall and apology, but of course, the game is already a bestseller, so the greedy executives will instead be laughing and plotting the next quarter-baked entry. In my opinion this game is worth no higher than a 0 out of 10. Even if you enjoyed parts of it, I cannot understand how anyone could rank this above a 6 when the game is so evidently unpolished. I'm sure other game companies are already taking note of people's willingness to tolerate unpolished games, and that's why this insulting product must be boycotted.

That said, you can't avoid the poor poor poor performance, the framerate is terrible and sometimes distracting.

The other annoying this is that the game only pretends to be open. If you want a good experience, you have to follow the route that's now listed on many websites, you can't just go anywhere, cause the levels don't scale. Either make it closed, or make the levels scale.

I am not sure that the devs even care or are trying. I think the Pokemon franchise is just a cash cow at this point that fans will mindlessly purchase. This will be the last time I preorder a Pokemon game.

The Good:
- New Pokemon Designs
- The attempt at shaking up the formula.
- The gimmick. A nice compromise between Z-moves and Dynamax.

The Bad:
- Graphics and performance. The game looks and runs worse than games on the switch that came out 5 years ago.
- The game has significantly less trainers than prior Pokemon games and the great majority of them only have one Pokemon to battle you with, which you almost always out level by 20 levels or so.
- No level scaling, which means even though its open world, there is little variation you can take from the planned route, and the fact that you are gate kept by the HM Pokemon that you ride on.
- I didn't think it would be possible to make a Pokemon game even easier than the Let's Go games or Sword and Shield, but here we are. This is by far the easiest Pokemon game due to lack of level scaling minimal trainers, and very simplistic and easy trainers.  For the Team challenges you have 10 minutes, which would be easy even for one who had significant intellectual disabilities, and provides zero challenge or reward to the vast majority of the population including children. The gym battles are the easiest in the franchise. I wish they had some respect for their audience and at least made it as difficult as Black and White or Sun and Moon. Considering adults make up the great majority of the video game player base.
- Androgynous character models. They made it so that all characters have the body of a boy. They got rid the ability to change your clothes. There is no skirt or feminine clothes for the character model. They went full woke gender neutral, which was a huge disappointment for most of the population.
- The ""three stories"" that were so heavily marketed are a variation of the same three stories (Pokemon gyms, team whatever, and legendary Pokemon) all Pokemon games have, except they are now told in a jarring and asynchronous manner that doesn't do the lackluster story any favors.
- No voice acting in a $60 dollar game. Seriously, still?
- Lack of endgame content. Most boring endgame of any Pokemon game."

tl;dr version
PROS: Exploration, Good Sense of Progression, Music, Gameplay
CONS: Poor QA & Performance, Uninspired World, Questionable Game Design in some spots

Review:
Relatively standard faire for pokemon, you collect the badges, stop the ""evil"" team and fill the pokedex but thanks to the open world nature of the game it's a little more conducive to the the longevity of the experience; the main storyline(s) had me clock in at around 50% longer than my average playtime for a pokemon game. Using your legendary gradually to traverse and explore more of the map feels satisfying as you unlock more of its abilities over the course of the game. The pokemon designs themselves are hit or miss, even moreso than last gen. I find it a bit funny that the gen that gave me my new favorite starter also gave me Shutterstock Flamingo Clipart #4337

While the game itself is pretty expansive, the environments themselves are actually relatively bland for a pokemon game; a lot of expanse but a whoooole lot of empty. It's lacking those cool landmarks you got in previous gens like the Abandoned Ship, Dragonspiral Tower and the Whirl islands to name a few. There is one area (hint hint) that stands head and shoulders above any other locations in this game and I'm sure you'll recognize it when you reach it and it only highlights that much more how uninspired the rest of Paldea feels by comparison. I just find it somewhat of a shame the world can't seem to match the whimsicality of the pokemon themselves.

The quality control on this game pretty much gamefreak saying ""Well, at least they can make it through the game without it catching on fire. Probably."" Worst performance of any pokemon game, bar none. It can be smooth in a few areas but the majority of the time you're gonna be dropping frames pretty hard. The switch itself isn't the paragon of gaming performance but a lot of games on the switch fit the same criteria of SV while looking and running better. On occasion you'll be encountering various visual glitches that find their way in your adventure. A lot of people are willing to laugh them off but they can be pretty immersion killing.

An extra year in the oven and this game probably could've been a 7 or an 8, but for whatever reason the devs and their overseers refuse to re-evaluate their production pipeline for these games. These games make billions but it would be nice if they could take a little more pride in their work instead of just rushing the games out of max profits."

  ",2,"The good: it's pokemon. The open - ish world is fun to move through. Seemless integration of battles into the overworld (except for performance and the camera dropping through the basement). A grand vision with so much potential... Unfortunately, most of that potential didn't make it.

The bad: locked into an extremely ugly school uniform (all 4 season apparel is atrocious, your bad taste in style doesn't change this fact). I get that being a student is part of the story, but you could have at least made the uniform half decent.

The really bad: how did a game with this many performance issues make it to release? Clipping. So. Much. Clipping. Don't blame the Switch. We have plenty of Switch games that are seamless. Rendering. God. Awful. Rendering. Again, it isn't the switch causing this, we have plenty of bigger games with higher resolution graphics rendering just fine. Graphics. Why is it that there are nintendo ds games with better quality graphics? One would think that amazing graphics could be responsible for the abysmal rendering, except both the graphics AND the rendering ****. Framerate. Why. Just... Why? Cutscenes with framerates so bad it's almost laughable, except this is supposed to be a professionally developed game, not a slapstick high school project.

Seriously disappointing game quality. It IS pokemon, and it is, therefore, fun. I love the change in play style, some very cool new pokemon, and I can have an eeveelution team rather early on. They hit the mark on some basic quality of life aspets. Definitely a good direction to be going, but it is very shameful how carelessly this game was developed. The half decent story and updated play style does not excuse poor craftsmanship."

Pokémon clip through the player character, the player clips through the floor/ground frequently, menus lag to the point that I had to check if my controller was still connected, the frame rate is laughable and the dips are absolutely ridiculous. It’s time for the Pokémon Company to move from GameFreak to a dev company that can actually create a decent product.

  ",1,"I lowered my expectations for what a new Pokemon game should be like after Sword and Shield disappointed me. Somehow, this game took even my lowest expectations and managed to be worse. It's an absolute abysmally-optimized lag-fest that was CLEARLY not ready for release. Almost every motion in the game is laggy, stutters, or drops the frame-rate. Everything is choppy and buggy. The game moves at a literal crawl. Almost everything in the environment is un-textured and super ugly. On top of this, the series continues going in the direction of anti-fun, with a forced experience share for the whole party, not showing stat improvements on level-up, a massively long and hand-holding tutorial, and (this is just what I heard) is still linear in terms of levels. You can *go anywhere* but if you do you'll just get the snot beat out of you for going somewhere you're not a high enough level for yet. Clearly Pokemon is not yet ready for the transition to Open-World gaming, as it somehow breaks everything whilst also being incredibly boring. Not to mention it's 2022, this is the NINTH main title for the series, and there is STILL no voice acting. Just tons of boring text on screen and awkward NPC mouth movements with no noise coming out. Now, before you think this is nothing but a hate-fest, I will say this: There are several improvements I can see they have made that I like. They are trying some new things out and some of the changes actually look interesting. That being said, those nice changes are pointless when made in such a terrible game as this. As someone who has ALWAYS bought a new Pokemon game on release, I now have to sadly say that I simply cannot do that anymore. What a waste of $60. It's insane how awfully this franchise is treated by its creators when its one of the most popular franchises worldwide. If you're on the fence, or just curious about it, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Heck, even if you're a die-hard Pokemon fan I don't recommend it. I love Pokemon, but these new games are simply sheer garbage."

It's still a Pokémon game, though, and the core formula, although beaten to death, has charm and fun. The pre-rendered stuff looks fine. The idea of an open-world core Pokémon game is fantastic, and this can be great - but GF really needs to patch the hell out of it, and soon.

  ",2,"Just gonna copy/paste my Scarlet Review in here. Basically the same game, so doesn't really change anything:

I won't get into the issues with this game here, due to 606 other negative reviews already pointing out the obvious stuff, and I agree with everything.
I will just say briefly, this game is a technical mess, but even the game itself is terrible.
A dead Open World with no actual life in it. No real improvements in terms of gameplay (the same battle system as Gen 1-8, but now even SLOWER.)
And a really weird difficulty balancing. There is no level scaling in this game, almost like they either didn't have time to put that in or this game originally was not supposed to be as open as it is now.
The game feels like they took an actual normal linear Pokemon game, but chucked it apart and threw it around in a bland boring Open World.

But one thing I really want to address:
To anyone who claims this game is the best Pokemon game ever made:
Please...stop insulting the 2D Pokemon games.
Even really old games like Pokemon Crystal are way better than this. Especially if you judge the games based on the timeframe of their release.
For a GB Game, Pokemon Crystal is awesome.
For a Switch Game, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet is a disgrace.
And if we include the timeframe both of these games released in, every single Pokemon game is better. Yes, even Sword/Shield due to being a more polished and working experience.

And no. The Switch hardware is not at fault here. We have seen how the Switch can handle games with Xenoblade 1-3 or even something less impressive, but still better than Pokemon...Breath of the Wild.

And to anyone who actually claims this is one of the best games ever made...
Please...play a good game for once...something made by people who respect your time and money.
Claiming Scarlet/Violet is one of the best games ever made is honestly an insult to actually good games.
For example: The Digimon series is made by people who have a clear passion for Digimon. How is it that these games have maybe 1/100 of the budget Pokemon could have, but pump out far more polished experiences?
It's simple. The Digimon Devs take their time to actually finish their product. They don't spam new games every new year.
This is the problem with Pokemon and why these games keep on getting worse.
Why is it that Zelda Breath of the Wild gets a sequel roughly 6 years after it's original release, but Pokemon just keeps on spamming games as hard as they can?
Why can't we get a polished experience LIKE Breath of the Wild for once.
Well, the reasons for ,,why"" are all there. You just have to open your eyes. Stop defending Gamefreak.
Or more likely...Stop defending the Pokemon Company in general.
Support games made by people who actually respect their playerbase instead of bullying it with 60$/€ Shovelware games.

,,Hey, let's spend 60$/€ on a game made by people who spit in the faces of their playerbase.
What? It's a fun game.""
This topic shouldn't be about if the game is fun or not.
This whole topic should be about if the Pokemon Company actually deserves your money for spitting in your face.
Please...everyone who gave this game a 6 or above. Have some selfrespect for yourself. Don't let big companies spit on you. Don't just accept that blindly ,,because it's fun"".

Nintendo America started to give out refunds for the game.
Let that sink in. NINTENDO(!) starts to accept refunds for a POKEMON(!) game.
If you don't know how huge this is and how big the insinuations here are, you obviously don't know Nintendo very well."

I had a magical moment of awe when I was battling a wild Jigglypuff, just a random encounter, but it was along a dusty road surrounded by fields of dried grass, the sun setting in the background as a flock of Fletchling fluttered by slightly up the hill. In that instance, I saw that golden flash of greatness this game has. Sadly, it didn't last. Soon, I noticed the flock aggressively shift to their bumpy long distance models while I could still plainly see them. After the battle, I turned back to look at the town behind me, and watched with disappointment as my framerate dipped into the 20's, only being able to sigh as I rode back to the Pokemon Center with game handling like it was full of mud.

This game is a dream that will keep jolting you awake with painful reality far too often for some (myself included) to enjoy. If you want to buy, wait for a patch or something. It just needs too much work."

  ",3,"A big wasted opportunity. As the first Pokemon game set in a true open world, you'd expect there would be tons of mechanics that would make use of all the available freedom, but nope, the game still plays the same as SwSh and somehow has downgrades when compared to their latest title, Legends of Arceus. All they really did was increase the size of the world, so instead of a linear route with many paths to explore, you get an empty and, most of the time, ugly overworld with a few mob spawns here and there. Story wise it's really mediocre even for pokemon standards, they tried to tell some weird tale about bullying, but it boils down to the generic (and almost verbatim) ""the true treasure was the friends we made along the way"", while making the characters seem they were the true villains in the end, even after their redemption.
I'm not even going to talk about the performance and bugs in detail, this game is riddled with them and you are probably tired of hearing complaints at this point. Cut content from previous titles? There are a bunch of these too."

The story, like every pokemon game after black/white 2, is uninspired and weak. Battling is fine, but the fixed camera is a step down from arceus. A lack of character desgn is disappointing and the school setting adds nothing to the story. The biggest dealbreaker is the constant gameplay glitches, graphical errors, and worst of all the terrible frame drops. The graphics are also just sad, crazy how this multibillion dollar franchise looks worse than games that cameout on the switch in 2017.

For the love of god Gamefreak and TPC, PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME ON YOUR GAMES. If Gamefreak just took an extra year for developing their games instead of releasing on every goddamn year they could create quality and polished pokemon games that run well and look good."

The main story has a deepness to it, and it’s quite moving. The side story involving the “villainous” team is entertaining, and the Titan path is very fun to play overall. Plus side, there’re no annoying rivals to the likes of Hau or Hop.

The open world aspect is everything I wanted. There’s a lot to explore, and the map is simply huge. It can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning, and I often end up sidetracked, doing other things instead of what I planned. Overworld shinies are back, only downside is that there’s no shiny sparkles or sound (which in a huge map makes the difference).

At 30h of play (still not at endgame) I’d rate my experience and enjoyment 10/10, with the game featuring a 8/10 because of technical issues."

- LP is a nice way to lessen the load on Money management

Now about the bad things
- Lagging and Warping graphic. I know this is Pokemon but... now is 2022 and you still can't solve the problem of lagging? Dropping in FPS is annoying. Other games with much more beautiful graphic has no problem running on Switch. Why can't you improve your graphic a bit? Maybe you did something wrong?
- Lack of trainer customization. You are locked out of Skirts or Fashion throughout the game. Seriously, this is 2022 and female character can only wear shorts in the game. This is a big downgrade. The choice of shirt is also limited to 4. This is so bad.

La nota que tiene actualmente por parte de los usuarios es completamente injusta y sobredimensionada, un ensañamiento sin sentido ni lógica. al igual que pasó en su dia con E/E, obviamente no es un juego de 10 (pues ningun Pokémon realmente lo es), pero una nota más sincera y objetiva que se acercaria a su realidad es 6, 7, u 8 si realmente te gusta.
El asunto de los bugs en un típico caso de histeria colectiva causaba por el nitpicking percibido en las redes, porque cuando uno juega, esa cantidad de bugs que uno piensa que le van a suceder, no suceden, sino una cantidad muy baja de estos.

Lo que si no tiene objeciones son los problemas de rendimiento, y es que los FPS realmente se **** en según que cosas, pero no considero que sea un justificativo de bombardear el 70% de la calificación con 0's absolutos, eso no es razonable.

I always felt like there was something to do. The main story took me about 40 hours to complete. It definitely had me smiling almost all the way through.
I had two issues with this game. The first isn't very clear where it wants you to go next. However, this is easily solved with a guide. The second is its performance. While playing I didn't encounter any major glitches. I did come across quite a few minor visual bugs but nothing game-breaking. Honestly, I feel as if most people are blowing these glitches out of proportion. I've played much worse games that were just outright unplayable. This on the other hand is very playable and quite enjoyable.
I love the 3 storylines. All three were very fun and well-written. Better than almost every story that has been presented in the Pokemon universe. The music in the game was catchy and memorable besides a few odd choices later in the game. I found that the online works well enough for the game. While some patches could be used to fix some of the awkward visual bugs I felt that the online worked well and I didn't have any issues connecting with friends to roam this amazing open world together. Another major highlight for me is the terra raids. I loved connecting with friends and random players online to compete in these raids. These raids work a lot better than they did in sword and shield. I also think game freak did a great job streamlining the way competitive pokemon works and the way breeding works in this game. I hope game freak gets around to creating a patch for some of the visual issues so the talk can start forming around everything amazing these games did right. If you are on the fence and are okay with a few visual glitches id say give this game a shot. If visual glitches run your fun well id skip out on it or wait till there is a patch. As a final word, these games kept me smiling and it was very hard to pull away from the addicting gameplay loop."

  ",4,"The open world and large items list are the positives. I would love to see those in the Kanto-, Jouto, Houen, and Shin'ou Pokémon games. The adventuring freedom like being able to challenge different gyms is fun as you are not blocked away from paths. The auto battling makes leveling up quick when you have better type matchups. You are able to buy type-boosting items and Mints with either money and League Points you have from beating trainers and getting Pokémon. You can also craft TMs.

The physics are the negatives. Everything flickers, you tend to teleport to far spots when you send your Pokémon out to battle, and you can get stuck on some land when riding. The Abilities never work outside of battles. Synchro no longer changes any wild Pokémon's Nature. That is taking away the variety of getting Pokémon that I often find myself reseting the game to look for a different Pokémon with the Nature I want. It is frustrating when you got a Synchro Ralts with any neutral Nature from the first area. It used to work in the past games since Emerald and even in Generation 8. It is as if SV were made around Legends: Arceus where that action RPG does not have Abilities, and even that was annoying. The character customization seems nice, but the problem is that TPC has a problem with separating the options by sex where the boys have the same hairstyle option as the female's, and can wear lipstick where even if the idea is based on kabuki actors, it is still pointless and weird. The character designs are doll-like like in New Pokémon Snap, and are just kind of creepy when seeing the bumps on the cheeks and depth around the eyes. Pokémon is supposed to be like an anime. It is not like we are expecting Grand Theft Auto graphics or whatever. Cel anime graphics like in the Nexomon and Gal Gun games should have been used to allow potential for much added content, fixed glitches, and smoother gameplay. Nexomon, Gal Gun, and even the Xenoblade games played fine on the Nintendo Switch.

People say that the Pokémon games should have went back to being 2D games. You can make video games like an anime, and they will sell if you can get the gameplay, physics, and graphics right. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX looks like the Generation 6 games for the 3DS in HD, and looks great and possibly play great too where even if the graphics are ""bad"", you do not see pop ins and outs nor get stuck in levels. I feel like I am better off with playing ports of old Pokémon games. Code Mystics and Inti Creates might make Pokémon games better without TPC rushing Game Freak, and be better than ILCA."

It looks unfinished. I know game tried to implement what fans have been asking but to release the game as final product in its current state? Meh. I know its a step in the right direction for pokemon but please stop rushing your games. It's performance is so bad.  I just hope they would release patches some time in the future.

Después del respiro que significó Leyendas Arceus, Gamefreak vuelve a sorprendernos con un lanzamiento inaceptable, apresurado y desprovisto de cualquier atención o cariño. Pokémon se corona, una vez más, como la franquicia que pese a haber calado tan hondo en la cultura (al punto de convertirse en el símbolo de una época) sigue decepcionando.

Pokémon no es cualquier cosa; es, de hecho, la franquicia más lucrativa de toda la historia y, sin embargo, por razones incomprensibles, recibimos una obra rota, injugable y con un apartado artístico mediocre. La entrega roza lo delictual, sobre todo si consideramos el peso económico que tiene la saga tras de sí.

Con cada entrega siempre albergo la esperanza de que Gamefreak y The Pokémon Company viren el rumbo. Pero mientras Pokémon pueda sacar cualquier trasto y venderlo sólo por tener un Pikachu, la excelencia —acostumbrada en Pokémons antiguos— está perdida."

Firstly, the elephant in the room. While I haven't experienced many performance issues myself, it is certainly an issue that can't be ignored. At worst, it is quite simply a major embarrassment for Game Freak.

Next, there's the cities. They all just feel empty and lifeless, in no small part due to most shops being turned into menus and not being able to enter buildings. It almost feels like a demo at times, even with all the people walking around.

Overall, I'm enjoying the game, but it leaves a lot to be desired, and really could have used more time in the oven. It's a shame delaying Pokemon games really isn't an option due to merch."

walking in the city is slow, and when looking at NPCs you can see them smoothly running by at 10 frames a second.

Sadly, no. Removing Switch mode completely takes out the element of preparing for type advantages mid-battle because you will always take a direct and lethal hit from the advantage against your set Pokemon. I know the games were developed simultaneously, but I do wish that some PLA elements were carried over. I don't want PLA 2, but after playing it, I realized just how good some of the ideas presented would be for the series as a whole, for both presentation and gameplay. (EX: There is a glowing beam of light telling you where to go as a Pokemon sits idle, with you needing to run into it for a cutscene to play. (Compare this to PLA just displaying a small signal on your map, with the cutscene beginning automatically once you enter the area.) The animation for things like battles, Pokemon in the wild roaming around, and the ""Let's Go"" action all felt off. It was a fun idea to sneak up on wild Pokemon and doge attacks that could cause them to fight you, forcing you to flee if you didn't want to fight those Pokemon. EV and IV training being streamlined were all great additions. I don't want game-overs, a genre change, or crafting systems; I want a shakeup of the formula and better presentation. Scarlet and Violet show glimpses **** game before delivering more of Pokemon Sword and Shield with worse performance and glitches.

I love this franchise, and I sincerely hope that these reviews reach the Pokemon Company's ears and that what they take away from them is ""Give the developers time and hire help."" rather than ""Never try anything new again."""

Taking even a cursory at glance at any other major Nintendo franchise, or even a majority of AAA franchises period, the shortcomings and limitations of Pokémon become impossible to ignore.

Violet and Scarlet may move some aspects of the franchise forward, namely in the open-world environments and less linearity, but still suffer from a chronic lack of ambition, scope, and polish.

Ever since the franchise's transition into 3D with XY in 2013, Gamefreak have been open about their desire to remove features, difficulty and complexity from the franchise, in an attempt to appeal to the ""kids of today"". Unfortunately, coupled with an increasingly brutal yearly release schedule, this has led most modern Pokémon games feeling barebones, empty, and at times, unfinished.

The abysmal performance and presentation of these games alone would be enough for me to not recommend them, but the added context of how little Gamefreak are utilising the Switch, how much better far smaller franchises consistently are, the laundry list of missing, basic features (voice acting, difficulty options and multiple save slots being big examples), and the rapid rate between releases, just make the situation so, so much worse.

In 2022, Pokémon has far more in common with franchises like FIFA, Call Of Duty, and Assassins Creed, than other premium Nintendo franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Smash Bros."

El gran problema de esta entrega es la dificultad que tenemos los jugadores para poder disfrutar todo lo bueno que nos ofrece ya que, y desde experiencia personal, hay un gran número de problemas técnicos como quedarse atascado en una posición extraña, que puedas ver bajo el suelo un vacío al batallar, que al lanzar una pokéball el mundo empiece a cargar en el fondo relentizando todo el proceso. El ""lag"" que se ve cuando llegas a un lugar con más objetos o personajes e incluso dentro de una sala de clases, que sólo esta cargando una habitación, presenta un ""lag"" y baja notable de FPS. Al parecer no todos sufren los mismos problemas ya sea por la consola o modo de juego, jugando en el modo portátil en una consola más reciente favorece pero aunque menos recurrente los problemas siguen presente. Y lo más extraño es la demora de carga de los iconos de pokemon en las cajas, algo que no debería ser.
Ahora dentro de lo gráfico los pokémon se ven genial, las texturas y animaciones en el mundo abierto lo hacen sentirse más real y vivo... pero el mundo le quita todo esa emoción con texturas de baja calidad, sombras pixeleadas que parecen más un trabajo abstracto, caminos desérticos o con pocos detalles. Simplemente parece un mundo echo por un estudio indi hace más de 10 años. Se entiende que es la primera experiencia de Gamefreak en este estilo pero con todos los recursos y conocimientos actuales pareciera que el orgullo de hacerlo a su manera destruyó cualquiera visión que tuvieran de un MUNDO Pokémon.
Jugabilidad, interacciones, los pokémon en sí son los mejores hasta la fecha. SI no fuera por estos problemas el juego sería la mejor representación de pokémon.
Notas: La obligación de compartir experiencia y el retiro del modo fijo es bastante molesto, el minijuego de los bocadillos es muy general y parece más un simulador de subway de baja calidad. El que al batallar tu personaje tenga que saltar sin una buena transición entre dos posiciones se ve mal, que los pokémon ya no cierren los ojos al estar dormidos se ve mal, aún pero cuando tienen animaciones para dormir en el mundo abierto. La demora de tomar decisiones en el juego donde el cuadro de dialogo se repite cada vez sólo ayuda a hacer más tedioso el proceso.

Before you say anything, no, it's not an unfair comparison considering they had well over enough to compensate (about well over 3 billion if you considered the sales of the last 3 Pokémon games). Why are we making poor excuses for a multi-billion franchise that could so easily give out the games we desire if they wanted to? Why are we so willingly settling for the bare minimum? This is nothing but embarrassing. I know when games like Fallout 76 and No Man's Sky released, people were tearing them up for the poor performance, but when Pokémon preforms poorly, it's ""just a little whittle oopsie?"" Really?"

Too bad the game is too easy and too candy. I would prefer it to be at least Pegi +12, with difficulty raised, and visible injuries on Pokemons.

The Pokémon brand is the most valuable media franchise in the world with an estimated combined turnover of 100 billion US dollars. They have all the money, all the power and all the ability to make the best games ever for what is arguably the largest and most passionate fan base in the world. But they're kidding us by making bad games over and over again knowing ""You idiots are going to buy it anyway.""

Graphics and performance are sub-par. And we all know from games like Breath of the Wild that the Switch can do more. And by God we finally deserve more from the most powerful franchise in the world!
Everyone who claims that the graphics aren't that bad is lying outright. It looks terrible, has performance drops all the time and you have the feeling you are playing an alpha at best beta game. The game is not finished, it is an early access title.

I've gotten to the point where I hate being a Pokemon fan because I spend my money on **** Because I ""have to"" spend my money on bad games simply because I'm a Pokemon fan. It just makes me sad."

  ",10,"I can't believe im about to defend modern pokemon but here we go; as someone who's played pokemon since 4 years old 98' this game is actually **** fantastic.  At the time of this review im 13 hours in with a ~120 caught dex count and have only explored maybe 25% of the map. I'm playing on a day 1 switch docked and have had 0 crashes, though, I'm no stranger to switch games crashing due to how **** the hardware is.

This game gives you something that has been lacking in pokemon for over a decade; the freedom and liberty to explore and immerse yourself into the giant world your put into. Exploring is both fun and rewarding whether it be finding new pokemon spieces, tms, items, materials, raid areas, etc. This a BIG improvement over the empty/tiny routes and  ""guided tour"" feeling of gens 7 and 8 and an especially HUGE improvement to SWSH's barren wild area. Simply put, the routes and cities are all a lot like they are in arceus but without being gated by how many Pokemon you caught and to get the most out of this game you have to play it like arceus; you have to want to genuinely enjoy exploring the world and completely the pokedex. if you're hoping to just run through the game going trainer to trainer until you reach the champion, you wont get any satisfaction out of this.

While I too would love an official pokemon game with challenging battles i've come to accept that its simply not something GF would ever do due to them wanting to keep this game accessible to everyone. This new style provides a much more fun and engaging experience than half assing the gameboy formula in 3d, while at the same time tying the franchise more closely with its tagline of ""gotta catch em all"".  If you want a challenging pokemon game, play and support rom hacks and fan games. There are tons of fantastic ones that fans have pour their hearts and souls into.

The game does lack polish, tips of character models feet and hands will clip through things. There is occasional slowdown most noticeably during trainer and wild pokemon battles, but nothing enough to ruin the game. When models are far the game has them in that low-res choppy animation, if you played SMT V you'll know what im talking about. Again not something that makes or breaks the game but not something the highest grossing franchise in the world should have in their game.

The graphics, while not perfect, are a HUGE step up from the lifeless husks and bland areas of SM/SWSH. While I will always prefer the pixel art of generation 5 I love how vibrant the world looks and the character and pokemon models are emotive and expressive.

There's no secret that this game has glitches, most of the ones I've seen on twitter are graphical glitches. The only one I've encountered in my 13h of gameplay was one single pokemon not loading causing a battle with an invisible wild pokemon. There are however, incredibly helpful or fun to do glitches, such as jumping backwards on your mount not making you slip off of cliffs or encountering pokemon in certain angles letting you skip past obstacles because your characters model ""jumps back"" when they enter a battle. As someone whos favourite things about RBY are the plethora of glitches to mess around with, glitches like this are an absolute joy and i sincerely hope the ones like the two i mentioned above don't get patched.

Tl;dr great game but poorly optimized for **** hardware, hopefully the series continues to go in this direction because the core of scarlet and violet is fantastic.

You cannot battle together, you cannot catch pokemon together and the tera raids are basically the same as if they were not in your game. They still have to join like if they were in their own game. WHY? WHY even have Co-Op if you CAN'T CO-OP ANYTHING? Also i know this game is designed for kids but this game is exceptional with hand holding elements. The older games provided more challenge and never held your hand through the game. The story is also basically the same concept that it has been since red and blue too. Most kids games have stories that are not as childish as this.."

Its. It's shame that old GC videogames look more developed than this game. Its 2022 and pokemons can't talk (only pikachu or evee), neither the characters. It seems the can't paid for voice actors. The combat music was great in sword and shield, not in this one.
It looks like only moneymaking is the goal of the company, they don't hide their intentions at all.

  ",0,"The game does not perform well, and it is so upsetting that it detracts so much from the enjoyment of the game.

I think it’s because the poor performance is indicative that other issues with the game are also a result of time constraints on development. So whereas before, you could look at things you didn’t like & attribute them to questionable game design, now anything that isn’t right you know 100% for a fact it’s due to the game being so rushed. For example, no level scaling for an game where you “can” challenge gyms in any order, not an intentional design choice, just not enough time to get it right. No battle mode set option, never been absent before, not intentional, just rushed. No shop interiors, no homes to walk into, and only pop up Pokémon centers? Not minimalist game design, just no time to fully flesh the world out. No voice acting? Not because of tradition, just the most profitable franchise in the world refusing to spend a dime on making these games better.

This game truly sits at about a 6, but because of the fanboys giving it 10's telling you, ""if you ignore everything that is horrible about the game, it's actually good!"" I have to give it a 0. If you went to pull out your first stake from the ground, saw the black screen with text saying ""you pulled out the stake, and it vanished,"" rather than an animation of it actually happening, you can't give this a 10.

  ",1,"I had no expectations going into this, basically steered clear of all trailers. And yet it still managed to disappoint. And I feel bad, you really see the developers tried within their timeframe. There's a solid game here, somewhere. Probably buried 3 more years in the future, and quite a bit of optimization in.

You really see the cut corners in the cities, scratch that. You see the cut corners everywhere.
But they're especially noticable with cities. Every house is a copy-paste model, without good shading. it feels like a proof of concept, rather than a game. One of the cities is literally built on a platform, since they didn't have enough time to work it into the environment..
And don't get me started on the textures.. people compare them to GameCube games. A fair comparison, only GameCube textures looked so much better. I've been playing a lot of Twilight Princess, and that game looks infinitely better than this tech-demo of a mainline Pokémon. The buildings feel like a part of the world, and altough dated, the textures are carried by phenomenal lighting and effects. Nothing of the like can be said about this empty husk of a world called Paldea.

I honestly don't think the open world adds anything to the experience. I challenged myself a bit, and did one of the later titans early. At level 20 I took on Iron Treads, and I even caught it. But my ingenuity was never rewarded, as I couldn't use him before I'd beaten another five gyms. The progression is extremely whacky. Instead of leveling the entire world just a smidge above the player, everything is treated as a normal ""on-rails"" pokémon world. After wandering around the empty wasteland, I made my way back to the Crab-titan. Thinking ""Oh! This'll be a challenge, seeing as iron Treads put of so much of a fight!"" - I OHKOd it. Didn't feel satisfying at all.

The story is virtually non-existant. It feels like they ran out of time with it, and just stuck with their concept-drafts.

I'm very disappointed, and I know my childhood self would be as well. It feels as if my younger selfs dreams of a open-world pokémon have been curb-stomped. My hopes for this franchise has continually been let down, and this might seal the nail in the coffin for me. I don't think I'll ever return to modern Pokémon ""games"". It just hurts."

  ",1,"Unfortunately, the game is clearly unfinished and was clearly rushed, leading to have a terribly high amount of issues which go from performance (awful framerate), decent/good environment but map completely empty (there is literally nothing between a city and another, not point of interests such as a battle tower, pokemon tower, ruins of alph, etc could be), uninteresting/dull/bland story clearly rushed just to have a story in the game.

GameFreak has decided to set for themselves a new goal: releasing two games per year, as opposed to the previous practice of releasing a unique one (not counting remakes with minor changes) every two years, doubling the number of products while halving the time dedicated to production. All of this is clearly a problem if the level of the released game is this one.

Unsure if relevant for a review, but I would say that 60$ for an unfinished and rushed game of this level is not reasonable at all, specially if you compare it the other Nintendo titles released for the same, or lower, price (Breath of the Wild, Bayonetta, Xenoblade, etc)"

  ",0,"The copy-and-paste design of the 'towns' in Pokemon Violet and Scarlet are shameful. In the main town with the university, you can find the exact same shops copied and pasted over a dozen times. Sometimes you will find the exact same shop next to itself up to three times. The vendors for crepes and kebabs are stationed across from clones of themselves. The buildings are poorly aligned with clipping and hovering. The textures used in many of the major parts of the town are such a low resolution you can count their pixel density on your fingers.

The shops are all just veneers aside from the sandwich shop and the barber shop which is just recycled from previous games. No interiors, no NPC shopkeeps, no themes, no design, no style, no aesthetic. Just a flat matte backdrop with the same item selection as every other shop. The shops have been dissected into a handful of vendors making it annoying and inconvenient to find what you want. A single nice restaurant could have taken the place of the ten or so food vendors. A food court even.

So many building are just facades with no ability to interact or explore. Often when the player is inside of a building they can no longer rotate the camera freely. This is despite the whole room being rendered, such as the classroom the player is first brought to. The cutscene shows the view from the professor's perspective, showing that the fourth wall has been detailed and rendered. The towns have nothing to offer. Most NPC's don't even have dialog and are just window dressing. You can find the same 6 npcs copied and pasted ad nauseum throughout every town.

Many textures are either stock from some asset pack, or so low quality it would look out of place in Mario 64. The singe texture used to blanket the entire ground for mountains is an eyesore. Look out from the main town and you can see a nearly endless sea of repeating hideous grey 'rock' texture covering 100% of the mountains. Go on the other side and it is the same but it is a single low resolution red 'sandstone' texture. The biomes have no transition between them; The red rocky plateau area clips hideously into the grey mountains. I have seen solo projects from students learning their first handful of skills in unity put out better work than this no-effort cash-grab.

The camera is a joke. It will incessantly clip into ceilings, walls, and through the floor. If you have the camera above you inside the main hall of the university it clips into the ceiling but the rings around the recessed light fixtures are in front of the camera. During battle if you are on an incline the camera will either be shoved beneath the ground during the victory animation or will be behind the incline making your entire view nothing but that 40x40px blob of ground texture.

The pop-in and graphical glitches are abysmal and should not be tolerated by consumers. Entire chunks of the distant mountain ranges will flicker in and out of existence. NPC's and Pokemon in the towns will blip in and out of existence 2-5 times as you approach them and will repeat that process if you back away from them. The lack of anti aliasing makes every angle in the game flicker and shimmer as the player moves around the game world. The framerate of animations will go from full down to 2-10 FPS if you get slightly further away from an NPC, or if you are in a cutscene - for example, during the intro cutscene in the classroom half of the students are doing the exact same animation with them slapping their hands and kicking their legs. All of these will be at 2-10 FPS during the whole cutscene. Then, once the cutscene is over they are back to normal FPS. Many textures are not solid or connected to their neighboring objects. An example is the columns in the main hall of the university; they do not connect to their bases or top blocks. You can look downward at the pillar and see the floor below in the gap between the pillar and its top.

The lack of clothing options is staggering when past games have had so much more. Go to the main hat store in the huge hub city and your options are a whopping TWO styles of hat (plus a single white beanie). Bag store has a whopping TWO styles. Clothing store has another hat variation. Glasses store has ONE style of glasses. The shoe and hat store both show six to seven different styles in their window, but both only have TWO when you go inside to buy, and for the shoe store neither of those two were in the window.

It is astounding to see each new low that GameFreak sinks to with every new Pokemon game released. It is an insult to consumers to charge full-price for this. No care or effort was put into making a product that was worth a consumer forking over that kind of money for. Every release is two steps forward, and a stylish triple backflip backwards. Unless this game is patched to hell-and-back to fix all the bugs and horrendous graphical fidelity, it is extremely difficult to recommend this game to anyone."

Some pokemon are so small on the overworld you need to squint to see them. Tera Raids online will desync if one player drops frames, sometimes allowing two moves before you can go, while the timer will also penalize you because the timer runs at a static 30FPS independent of game performance, because of this, the enemy pokemons HP will bounce up and down because it doesn't know what to do, preventing some raids from being completed. Lags and drops frames frequently, The target lock on UI and other things have been removed and there's no crosshair to show what you're aiming at, camera is wonky in pokemon battles, and sometimes, your pokemon will just fall through the earth or clip into the ground during battles, just making an empty void.

The only game more people on my list bought and played more is Mario kart. Everybody is playing and I can't get Pokemon off my mind. So many Pokemon to catch. I get geeked when I discover a new Pokemon I haven't caught yet. I'm excited. I bought Pokemon sword and shield and hated them, bought Pokemon Arceus and hated it to. I haven't played a Pokemon game this much since the original. I had to deduct a point because some of the frame drops from time to time and some pop in, but none of this is game breaking, especially with what all this game is trying to achieve. It's a pretty game, with weather effects and personally I liked the graphics. This world is overflowing with life and sounds. I also liked how easy it is to throw a poke ball, I liked seeing my character, my Pokemon and the enemy Pokemon. I liked that I could call my Pokemon to quick fight in the area and collect level up points. I liked the music. I liked the hd rumble and wish they used it more. I don't like how my Pokemon evolves, but that's my fault because I chose him. So Pikachu is now my quarterback Pokemon and I benched quaxly. I love everything about this game, it's freedom, it's open world structure. I didn't like the five hour tutorial of reading and wish Pokemon would graduate into voice acting. Is it perfect?

  ",3,"While the core gameplay is fun, and *some* innovation from Legends Arceus came through, the game is so fundamentally broken on a technical level that it is impossible to give anything above a 3/10.

So many features were cut from previous instalments that opens up questions regarding Game Freak's intentions; do they want players to enjoy themselves or feel frustrated?

As is with every mainline Pokemon game, there is a 1 step forward, 3 steps back rule. The over-world catching and combat is great, but there are no Shiny sound effects. The models are minuscule (the smallest of the Pokemon are neigh invisible which makes it incredibly frustrating). For some reason the Set/Switch option was taken out of the game. Still no sign of a quick-EV training minigame such as the ones from X/Y. So many quality of life features are missing, with little to nothing to show for it.

The over-world size is as expected of an open world game, but what isn't expected is the poor graphical fidelity of it, as well as nearly every other aspect of the game, besides the Pokemon themselves, which seem to have gotten model refreshes. The most striking ones are the metallic Pokemon, such as the Pawniard line, which have a shiny metallic finish which really gives it an extra oomph. The rest of the game looks like a poor Playstation 2 era port ****.

There are so many glitches, bugs and micro (as well as macro!) stutters. Overall, the game does not achieve 30 FPS at any given moment, at least not in my case. There is constant popping, light and shadows completely breaking and stuttering, clipping through terrain and objects, entire cities blacking out, deleting and then reappearing in the span of 3 seconds, horrible FPS drops and stutters whenever Pokemon spawn, or, lord forbid, you enter a city. Seriously, city proximity turns the game into a slideshow.

Over half of the Pokedex has once again been cut out of the base game and I have no doubts they will once again sell you bits and pieces of it through a paid DLC. Horrible practice, especially for a €60 first-party Nintendo game.

Game Freak needs major restructuring. Whether it's more development time, more staff, or a complete work environment overhaul; something needs to change. A $90 billion franchise cannot allow itself to treat their mainline games in this manner. Not only are there massive cuts in the content of each subsequent games, the games are releasing more broken than ever. The visuals aren't just outdated, they are antiquated. Either all of the issues need to be addressed, or Game Freak needs to stop charging €60 for broken, unfinished games. Charge it like every other developer releasing what is clearly an Early Access game, a nice and fair €20.

This is unacceptable, and Game Freak should feel nothing but shame for this product release."

The map stutters and lags when zooming in or out. NPCs randomly vanish. Shadows don’t have any sort of relation to the things casting them.

  ",3,"This game has amazing ideas... One of the best mechanics they created using the idea of the mega evolution which naturally evolved into this one (really, will make competitive quite better and funnier). But, doing it open world just spoils the entire level design, it's a nice idea but poorly implemented, they didn't add a level cap or something like scaling levels to yours, so you can easily break easily the game. Not gonna spoil story or so, it's quite nice, not high level but enjoyable.

I would rate it a bit higher because of those nice things, they don't annoy me enough to not enjoy the ride, but the moment you notice they are a AAA franchise, they sell full price of an AAA, it looks worse than some indies and they don't really innovate that much as indies do... and give you this badly optimized game, which is even more criminal if you think that they literally developed it to work with Nintendo Switch, it's not a port like a third party. A Game that is exclusive and does not work perfectly fine in it's console is a failure.. That plus nonexistent post game that they will probably sell apart as a ""DLC"" just like they did with Sword and shield.. Still, it's called Pokemon so even if this one is a disaster they will keep selling millions and decreasing the quality because they can."

  ",4,"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the worst running Pokemon games that have ever been released. There is horrendous pop-in, a low and inconsistent framerate, and has various hangups when doing just about anything, including entering menus or entering battle. On top of this, it somehow manages to look worse than any other Switch based Pokemon game, and even worse than Pokemon Colosseum, a game on the Gamecube from nearly 20 years ago.

The gameplay is acceptable in some places but takes several steps back in others. Customization is severely limited, and you are not able to change your clothes beyond 4 outfits. The Battle Tower and any post game facilities are gone, likely to be included in a future DLC, if at all. For some inexplicable reason set mode is gone and you are unable to change basic things such as skipping battle animations. You are advertised as being able to challenge the gyms in any order but this is very misleading, as there is no scaling on the gyms, so doing them out of order will mean you are going to either be too high of a level or too low, and never on par with the gyms.

If a future patch fixed all the bugs and performance then the games would still only be about a 6-7, just due to the removal of features."

This game is like buying a brand new Ferrari. A Ferrari that comes with holes in the body and rusty metal and sometimes when you round a corner the steering jolts back and forth and your adrenaline spikes with the danger. And sure sometimes you have to pump the brakes to get it to stop and the blinkers don't work and a headlight is constantly burned out. But at its core it is still a Ferrari despite all of its issues and the soul is somewhere hidden under all the problems and annoyances and migraines. But it is deep under and I don't know if it is even 100% fixable and it is so heartbreaking to experience. I wish all the love to all the people who put their heart and soul into developing and producing this game, they don't deserve the hate they are getting. But I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone and am contemplating making this my very first video game I've had refunded. I hope after some soul searching game freak can find its way again to producing amazing pokemon games but after this one, I think corporate greed may win out again. Game freak take a page from hello games and just own up to this failure and work on fixing it. You need to earn our trust back, this will be the last pokemon many of us play if this is your strategy from here out. So much potential wasted and turned into utter disappointment. Don't ignore the fans who put you in this position, we deserve better."

This one has decent story telling, and in my opinion, is a fundamentally better game than sword and shield. It comes with a lot of content, and it doesn’t deserve to be considered bad by any means, if you’re a fan of Pokémon games.

However, there are better ways to spend $60. Xenoblade 3 is great, give that a try if you don’t like Scarlet and Violet. Regardless, it’s not a terrible way to spend your money. It’s a good 30 hours of enjoyment if you speed through it, and probably like 80 to 100 hours if you take your time and play the game."

Already existing Pokémon have benefited from some updated models too, with added detail that can look great.
Disappointingly, that same passion was not put into the rest of the game. The game is plagued with technical and graphical problems, as well as bland open world exploration, objectives with very little focus or direction, and a fairly dull story.
Playing this game feels like beta testing an open world expansion for Pokémon Sword/Shield. Far from the exciting new generation of the highest grossing franchise of all time that was promised.
Game freak have taken several steps backwards after the interesting shake up they brought us with Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and in future would definitely benefit from a much longer development cycle.
Overall, a disappointing experience that I cannot recommend to anyone except hardcore Pokémon fans, interested in catching some exciting new Pokémon designs."

Hell, I obviously did too. I love Pokemon and I am planning to play through Scarlet & Violet (unlike Sword and Shield, couldn't finish that **** the technical aspect just can't be ignored anymore. I'm sure everybody who owns the game has seen or at least heard about it and it really is a problem that dampers the enjoyment. I'm not a graphic critic at all but a big game like Pokemon in this state is just unacceptable. Also, why they didn't include the Arceus catching system, even though it would perfectly fit in these games, is questionable. That's coming from someone who has played the games since the first generation! Pokemon Legends feels like a natural progression in the series and not going further with it just makes it seem not well thought out.
Overall I am just highly disappointed, just like I have been with Sword & Shield.

Everyone who wants to play it will play it anyway but don't just accept the issues. I hate that every time another Nintendo game gets announced, like a new Mario, Zelda or even Fire Emblem, we're excited because we're sure that the games are going to be great. But everytime a new Pokemon is announced, we now have low expectations."

Está lleno de bugs y el rendimiento ralentiza tanto el juego que hace pesada la experiencia del jugador. Hay una mejora notoria en cuanto al decorado de los ambientes y las texturas del pelaje de los Pokémon está muy bien logrado. Se nota que le han puesto empeño al diseño de los Pokémon, pero hasta ahí. El juego tiene más fallos que puntos positivos y es una pena porque el juego sería mil veces más disfrutable sin esa bajada de FPS tan grandes y constantes. También que el juego se cierre constantemente y tenga tantos fallos de programación. Recomiendo explorar a pie que utilizar la montura para que el juego le de tiempo a cargar los Pokémon. De lo contrario, se queda un mundo vacío que te asaltan Pokémon que aparecen bajo tus pies. Pokémon Leyendas Arceus es la verdadera experiencia de mundo abierto y de exploración que debería seguir mimando Nintendo (o incluso zonas amplias como las vistas en Pokémon Espada y Escudo) y dejar la aventura por rutas a los juegos principales. Nada de mundos gigantescos que luego se sabe que no van a rendir bien por el año que tienen desarrollando cada juego principal de Pokémon.

En conclusión: un juego roto y con un rendimiento inaceptable. Pretende ser un Pokémon Leyendas Arceus cuando el equipo de programación no está habituado trabajar en 3D ni puede terminar un proyecto tan ambicioso con la exigencia empresarial de año por desarrollo. Eso es literalmente IMPOSIBLE y siento que el equipo directivo lleva un tiempo que no tiene claro la EXPERIENCIA QUE QUIERE PLASMAR EN CADA NUEVA ENTREGA DE LOS JUEGOS PRINCIPALES, lo que hace que su continuidad parezca un popurrí de ideas beta que les da igual cómo quede con tal de que salga al mercado y sigan ganando dinero."

Alcuni dei pochi punti a favore dei giochi sono il worldbuilding per la storia ma NON per le interazioni con hli NPC che non cambiano mai, la funzione open world, e le cavalcature di Koraidon e Miraidon.

Die Kämpfe selbst sind ganz ok bis gut gemacht, wobei ich sagen muss das ich festgestellt habe, das wenn ein Pokemon in Schlaf Status versetzt wurde, hatte es trotzdem die Augen nicht geschlossen und man sieht diese ZzZzZ schlaf animierten Buchstaben bei geöffneten Augen....creepy ich schlaf iwi bei geschlossenen Augen.
In diesem Spiel kann man so viel räumlich glitchen, Pokemon die iwo in Wänden auch während eines Kampfes fest hängen. Kamera die unter den Boden durchschauen kann. Dieses Grafik-desaster,

- The Pokemon designs not only are the most forgettable in the franchise, but they feel out of place, incoherent, even BAD.
- Not that Gigantamax was great, but Terracrystalization simply isn't well implemented, like other new mechanics. Once you use it, you have to go back to a Pokemon center and recharge it, so you'll end up using it around 10 times in the whole game.
- About the story and structure, one cannot help but compare it to Fire Emblem Three Houses with its multiple paths, the academy, etc., but it looks GameFreak just forgot about a good cast, memorable situations and a good story. And let's obviate the tehcnical optimisation.

However, the new region finds some charm here and there, inspired by the Spanish and Portuguese cultures (as Sword and Shield so well did), mainly in the interior designs and the exterior of houses. The bigger size of the region, helps the game feel more immersive at times, although at the same time, the lack of coherence and engage makes it also feel more inert than ever. It feels rather empty.

Overall, they are fine game. If you're expecting a Pokemon game, these are Pokemon games. But their inspiration and polish leave a lot to desire. It tries more than Sword and Shield. Fails much more than Sword and Shield. Better than Legends Arceus? Sure. Some additions are welcome, but the thing is that for each one of them there are 5 mistakes or downgrades.
With great potential, Scarlet and Violet fall near the bottom of the franchise, but still make for a decent game."

- Good selection of Pokemon from previous generations to add to the new ones.
- Different branches of the story to play through in whatever order you want to.
- Pretty standard Pokemon experience.

Cons:
- FPS... Oh boy. The game feels like it's falling apart right from the start. Even walking around your house, a small and finite area, was a huge chore. The game stutters along while your Switch cries out in pain from start to finish.
- The open world... I love open world games. They should be full of secrets and rewards for exploring. Pokemon SV has none of that. They've created a fairly standard open world with standard terrains, but other than more Pokemon and more Pokeballs/Potions to find, there's not really any point straying off the main path.

  ",5,"For starters, I love Pokémon, therefore this is far from a review bomb. It's just the truth...people stating they have experienced no frame drops or slow downs in the games current state are either bots or **** of right now the slow downs, and choppy frame rates are worse than anything I have ever experienced since W2K18 on Switch. (I only played that to see how awful the frame rate and slow down was.) Game freak clearly needed an extra year to work out the bugs, considering they were also working on Arceus. (Which I feel is the best Pokémon game I have played since Sapphire version)  As of right now the game is virtually unplayable, lighting disappears at times, Pokémon clip through the environment and constant skips and jitters plague cutscenes...whoever optimized Arceus needs to help with a patch on Scarlet and Violet..underneath all of the crippling tech issues could have been the best Pokémon game yet."

  ",0,"This game is a shirine to the arrogance of the Pokémon corporation. To see how little effort they can put in a game before people will push back. Let me also be clear. This is the fault of those at the top. You can tell the developers who actually make the game were extremely rushed on this with rough draft textures, miscalculated variables for distances, stuttering, and so many missed errors. When a company demands too much in too little time, quality goes right out the window. And when a company thinks that this is fine, it isn't. It is disrespectful not only to the customer, but to those who put in so much hard work on the game itself. Like I said this is the shrine of arrogance of the Pokémon corporation.

My husband teaches video game design. His discussion assignment for next week was picking out 3 different clips that he found online of bad technical issues in the game he could find. He asked his second year students what the issue was (bad texturing, pop ins, clipping, unfinished environments, how the variable/distance formula is probably wrong & causes choppiness, & more complex **** I genuinely don't know) and to write up why and how they would fix the issues.

That should not happen. I can only imagine how many talented indie developers right now would be begging for the opportunity to treat this series with the care it deserves. And they should take it over. Anyone should that would give this franchise love.

I also want to touch on gaming journalists giving this game still a 70/100, 80/100, or similar C-C+ ratings. You guys are doing a massive disservice to fans and the corporation itself. Most of you will chastise this game for the technical faults over and over then give it a decent rating. Why? You guys need to be honest; Pokémon IP or not. We all love the franchise. But if you can't be honest that the technical issues should impact a score dramatically, then we will lose our faith in you. Call it and accurately rate it what it is. Ask yourself if it wasn't a Pokémon IP, would I still give it this rating? We both know the answer.

A lot is wrong here. From a corporation taking hard work down the drain, to a teacher using a AAA game to teach students what not to do, to gaming journalists not being outright honest with the scoring, this is all just so, so disappointing from so many angles. I haven't touched on the specifics of the game, but I feel I don't need to. It's been done. But I truly hope this franchise gets the love it deserves and fast."

Technical Issues: - Performance is atrocious for a triple-AAA company releasing on a stable console OS.

- The game has serious fps drops on my new Switch OLED. I get drops that feel as low as 4-8 fps, and the game seems to barely be above 25 fps. It’s giving me a headache.

- There are shadows flickering all over the place. NPC and Pokémon shadows are barely 10 pixels each. It feels like trying to run a PC game on low because you do not meet the recommend specs.

- NPCs move around like robots at 3 FPS like a slideshow, unless you are very close to them. - Many times the camera clips underground and you can see the abyss below. This happens often in trainer battles that are on elevated ground. - On several occasions I have fell through the floor and had to reset my Switch OLED because I was stuck in the “falling” animation.

- Character movement is so weird and clunky. You move like a robot too, snapping into a locked position when ascending/descending. Movement isn’t fluid and realistic. - Lighting is as bad as it gets. Many times the time of day causes your character to look pitch black (even though you are white). Other times the lighting causes your character to look completely white like a ghost.

Weird Graphics:
- Graphics are atrocious in my opinion. I’d rather have the more cute, bright and “cartoony” style of SwSh than this more “realistic” style mode. It’s creepy because Pokémon now look like actual real animals.

Empty World:
- The world is big but barren and depressing. There is no depth and detail to anything. The world is as big as the ocean but as deep as a puddle. There is just nothing to see or do, other than traverse large distances that are empty of content. The cities are entirely dead, the majority of the NPCs can’t be interacted with, and all the stores pop-up Trade UI menus to buy and sell. There are no store interiors any more. The lazy failures didn’t even design a simple clothing shop. Character: - Character customization is terrible. There are only 4 outfits that are just ugly. Tights pants that are orange with stripes? Who thought of that? It’s like you are wearing clown pants. Every player looks the same now. There is zero diversity. Zero role playing value. The accessories you can change (gloves/hat/bag) are a few recolors that feel pointless since the main attire is disgusting. SwSh had the best clothing options, especially with the DLCs. You could role-play as anything. Not any more. You are stuck wearing clown-pants with suspenders throughout the game. Pokémon: - The new Pokémon are mediocre. They are literally a pig, a flamingo (named Flamigo), and a few birds. It looks like Animal Planet. Not a Pokémon game.

Verdict:
This is definitely an early alpha version of the game released to the public. People need to start getting fired at Game Freak because this garbage is not a video game. This is really sue-able; especially if they do not offer refunds."

Legends arceus was a step in the right direction. What happened here?

Pokémon is the highest grossing media franchise in global history, yet Gamefreak can't be bothered to release a finished game. You need to add voice acting (why do you even bother animating lip movement, incredibly awkward); significantly improve graphics and animations; balance megas and add them back in; and actually finish the product for release.

Ignoring the technical issues, the game lacks the kind of content that made the older games so beloved. The postgame amounts to an extra 40 minutes of story to conclude the game, a **** battle facility (calling it that is not even really accurate), 6/7 star raids and a wild area-esque area for catching Paradox Pokémon. **** GSC had more content than this, and that was on a 2 MB cartridge for a 20 year old console. Hell, Crystal even has a Battle Tower, which this game lacks. There's no excuse.

Honestly, I haven't even touched on the various problems I have with this game, but pointing out the main ones should be enough to tell you everything you need to know about it. It is not acceptable for a game from the biggest franchise in the world to be released in this state at full price, and if there isn't a series of patches to fix the numerous issues with the game, then I would be very dissapointed.

The graphics are an imposition, the poor performance a kick in the groin for any gamer. Content has been removed (again) in favor of new content. And this new content works grotty. As a player, I'm unable to throw a Pokéball up a hill because the aiming mechanic of Legends Arceus has been taken out. The auto combat feature sometimes works or it doesn't. Ambushing Pokémon no longer has any appeal, as I can't throw empty Pokéballs either. I have to cancel evolutions every time I level up. In this texture mud, I repeatedly traipse over Pokémon that I just can't see. And the great audio feature that made finding Shinys in Legends Arceus easier is also gone.

The game character is an empty shell. Thirty years now I've been playing video games. And it's the second time now that I would have loved to hammer the A button in a role-playing game instead of drowning in this tidal wave of platitudes and these dull attempts at fraternization. Watching the unsightly slush that is supposed to represent grass grow is more interesting than any NPC I've run across. If you have trouble reading, you won't be served a soundtrack here either and will have to slog through text box after text box after text box.

NPC's move as slowly as the entire game feels. It's sluggish to the point of falling asleep. The open world has no appeal when I do end up being compelled to do exactly what you've been doing in Pokémon games for more than 25 years: collecting medals. Because exploring and finding new Pokémon is ruined by the leveling system. I can't go and collect and use whatever I want afterwards. Because I absolutely need a medal to control this new and powerful Pokémon. Exactly the opposite is the appeal of an open world. To venture into dangerous terrain and then take home some particularly good loot. But I can't have that very loot. No, I have to go back to doing what the developers want me to do. The freedoms are as limited as some rooms in this game. They have several doors, but I can't open them for unknown reasons, such as the door in my own house to the garden or the master bedroom. With this setting, there is no need for these doors in the first place.

Pokémon Violet and Scarlet is a sandpaper to the eye and a purgative of good taste. If there were an invective award for video games: This game would win the main category for two years. Because that's how long the experiences made will haunt one's nightmares."

I found myself wanting to go back to other Pokémon games as I was playing it as I have that itch to catch Pokémon, but not in this game. I also found myself dizzy as the frames would drop so low it would make the screen stutter constantly, especially in the big city area. I understand the switch hardware isn’t great, but I just finished Xenoblade 3 and that game was lighyears better optimized than this. Pokémon really needs to stop taking steps and just reach its destination already…."

The world is very lovely and nice and the freedom the game gives you is great. The characters are amazing as well and I can say that this is a good pokémon game. However, the fact that it runs absolutely horrible compared to other more demanding games on the switch is really absurd. The textures also are not the very best but I personally do not mind it.

I had already written a review of Pokemon Scarlet. I don't think I need to repeat myself. The game is a broken piece of garbage full of bugs, glitches, pop-ins, awful framerate, crashes, freezes, stuttering, clipping issues, stuck on black screen, you name it. Metacritic needs to bundle these games together for reviews, because it is the exact same trash. Just because the developers cut the game in half doesn't make it a different game. It is still the same game split in half.

The graphics are a joke. They are charging $120 for goodness sake, we should expect much better graphics at that premium price. Stray was $30 at launch and Dakar Desert Rally is $40, both of these games look 100 times better. Game Freak has more money than Stray and Dakar devs combined by a landslide, and this game cost way more than those 2 games combined. Nintendo and Pokemon make billions of dollars meaning there is literally no excuse for such puke-worthy graphics from these cheap and lazy developers. It's funny how Pokemon fans make fun of Call of Duty for being the same game every year. What does that make Pokemon then? At least Activision doesn't charge $120 upfront for a shovelware game.

As of right now with the insane price of $120, I can honestly say without a shadow of doubt that this is the worst game I have ever played in my life. Keep in mind that I have been playing video games since the Atari days. Nintendo, you better start contacting those retailers about refunds because I expect a full refund. You will not get away with the biggest heist of the video game industy. Speaking of which, this game is the laughing stock of the video game industry. I am beyond infuriated with this scam.

I will tell the truth about this game, since I played it when came out and not a leaked version without a patch day 1.
It is one of the best regions and it perfectly refines what has been achieved with Legends Arceus, graphically its a great leap in quality, and in terms of exploration, it is something that the saga would hardly have dreamed of years ago.
Accessibility and quality of life improvements are much better, making the competitive something more open to all audiences.
In story, its one of the best that the saga has had, and the inclusiveness that this game brings goes with the quality line that others have had in Nintendo lately.

I played with the patch day 1, and after passing the league, I have only found 1 bug, merely aesthetic and that didn't affect my experience at all.

But the graphics look better overall. In addition, there are many things that make Scarlet and Violet better. The open world, for example, fascinates me even more. Unfortunately my english is not the best. So let's make it short: Scarlett and Violet are one of the best Pokémon Games I have ever played. I would normally give an 8.

  ",2,"As a long pokemon fan, i find this game insulting in many ways. I had always tried to find the good in all the last pokemon games to find em more enjoyable and fun, but this is just unacceptable.

First, let's pretend this is a finished product (when it is clearly not) subjectively find the design of the new pokemon really lame and poorly inspired, the worst generation by far. Too much humanoid evolution and so many weird evolution. That is just my taste though so it wont matter much in the score.

The story and narrative is good at times but quite bad and messy overall.
The difficulty is completely unbalanced, since level scaling dont exist and as such you can trivialize most of the challenges simply chosing a certain order.
I dont expect much from a pokemon game in these two categories though, so i can let that slide.

The real problem is: the game is totally void. It is big in its scope, but devoid of any type of activity, sidequest, interaction with npc. City are totally empty and useless, the open world is big without a level design. You just roam around to pick items at some point, since if you challenge all the trainer you will fing yourself overlevelled, unless you constantly change your party making it weaker on purpose. I am not even talking about team star base and ""boss"", such a disappontment

The quality of life is  reduced from some of his previous interaction, you cannot turn down the animation and fight style is fixed on set, so you cannot decide to turn it down from option, just like the exp share.

Honestly, a pokemon game even in its lowest moment managed to be fun since its core gameplay is extremely rewarding and functional per se, even considering its poor story, childish character development, low difficlutybut and mid to low level design in puzzle and exploration. This time they manage to make a pokemon game almost boring, even as a die hard fan.

That would be a 6 for me, if not for the fact that this game is not finished. It should not have been sold in this state, it is like a alpha rather than a finished product.
Aside for the low quality res and texture, except for the pokemon model which are greatly improved from the previous game, everything is a mess.
Performance is really bad, 15 fps in some moment even lower, despite being few object on screen,
camera angle problem, glitch, soft lock and some real issue about lighting and npc modeling.

The switch is not the problem, optimization is.
This is the first time i am asking for a refund, it should be illegal to sell a game in this state."

Beyond being essentially non-functional on the technical side, the game's another creative downgrade. Player customization in terms of clothing has been almost entirely removed. The little bits we have left, like socks, hats and gloves clash with the game's uniforms.

Cities are basically empty. 90% of houses are inaccessible facades. And 90% of the remaining 10% are shop menus. You don't even enter a shop anymore and see customers/mannequins. It's just a menu where you select purchases from.

I wanted to buy Violet, but then I've started to see the reviews by ''specialized critics'' here and all over the internet, and I've thought ''mmm, maybe waiting is better''
I've started to watch some livestreams on Twitch to see the game
Best decision I've ever done
Games without a soul, published in a FEW MONTHS (Pokémon Legends came out at the beginning of this year if you don't remember it) just because childish **** were impatient for the new generation
But hey, the game will sell anyway, so why publish it in 2 years?
The major responsibles of this disaster are exactly the consumers
I can understand those who say ''I want to buy it because I want to touch it with my hands in order to judge them''
But those who always say ''Even though the game will **** I will buy it because I want to see the new pokémon'' or ''because I want to have the new pokémon game in my collection just to expose it'' or ''because I don't want to miss the new generation''
if you only care about the fu**ing monsters play Pokémon GO and Unite, I've got both of them, and they're cool
If you only care about mere phisic possession of the game you're nothing but SLAVES
Pokémon is dying from the beginning of the 6th gen (including the remakes of Hoenn and Sinnoh which are not bad, but so far away from Heartgold and Soulsilver), and you don't even realize it

  ",1,"Never have Action RPG, bring it back.
Not evolving to Wyrdeer, Ursaluna, and Kleavor in this game without evolution items, such as Peat Block and Black Augurite.
Also, poor graphic and technical issue should not release next three year. Make it graphic realistic and better technical performance for next 4 years rather than three years.
Look how awful is.... 4 years next generation release date, no three years release mainline."

  ",3,"Rose colored pokemon goggles shouldn't save the performance dumpster fire of Scarlet and Violet.

Characters and animations often move at a robotic 3fps, clipping, pop ins, stuttering, pausing between actions, ugly textures, wonky camera - and it happens non-stop.
Whilst the aging switch hardware is a limitation, there many other better looking and more expansive games that run way better than this.

If somehow you can get past all the performance issues (I couldn't) the game play itself feels mediocre at best. A lot of the innovation introduced by Arceus is ignored here.

Music and sound is poor with weird silences throughout and the lack of voice acting for a fully realized 3D adventure is disappointing.

If you want to play a Pokemon game I recommend any other in the series over this. After the ""fresh air"" of Arceus, this game is a new stifling all time low."

  ",4,"Game just is a buggy mess and runs extremely poorly. Not at all indicative of what this system is capable of. It's clear this wasn't given enough time. Framerate drops, pop-in, visual bugs, etc. Any other first party Nintendo title would've been delayed in this technical state."

  ",0,"I have never been more disappointed by a mainline Pokemon game. There's so much wrong with this game that 5,000 characters could never be enough. The optimization issues, level of graphical fidelity, bad animations, bugs, lack of scaling, removal of set mode, removal of the ability to disable battle animations, the hideous character designs, the continuation of one generation long battle gimmicks, and incredibly low target audience age for this game in particular."

  ",9,"I think pokemon scarlet and violet are good games. The lags and bugs are so annoying tho. But i really like the open world. One thing i dont like is the teracrystallation. Just a bright low poly version of pokemon with goofy hats that make your defense and attacks a bit better or idk, not even new attacks. but overall w game"
