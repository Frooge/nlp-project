  ",10,"Since I was played gen 3 pokemon game, this one version gen 4 is more than an improvement from the previous diamond and pearl. It was far more better than I expected, the intro was epic, the difficulty was balanced, enhanced pokedex, upgraded ui, the villain was more villain than the diamond and pearl, the distortion world is fricking shocker and etc. It's all mixed altogether into a masterpiece. I love the sinnoh pokemon, it was great, a lot of varieties and pretty nice design. But I was dissapointed when the copies sold was far than the expectation, although the quality they've given we're really great to fixed the sinnoh region. This version will goes into my heart, and it will be my best pokemon I've ever played."

It has the best story of any pokemon game (again, for me), and an incredible roster of new pokemon like Infernape, Torterra, Luxray, Staraptor, Lucario, Mamoswine, Weavile, Gliscor, Floatzel, Togekiss, Garchomp, Roserade and so on.

It also has a really balanced dificulty, an incredible champion, the best legendary backstories, pretty graphics, etc. This game brings back childhood memories like no other, and for that it's a 10 for me."

  ",8,"The fifth entry in the most popular franchise in the world, Pokémon Platinum is arguably the best of the main game series. It takes everything its predecessors did before it and perfectly executes on every aspect of its design. The story is likely the best Game Freak has to offer and the writing of the story perfects what its sibling games Diamond and Pearl did have going for them.

If playing in the Sinnoh region for the first time, Platinum is the best way to experience it. The world and its lore is strong and engaging, with a sense of mystery to the story surrounding it. The way the player is introduced to some of the deeper elements of the story is masterfully done, and hasn’t really been replicated in a Pokémon experience since. Everything from the ominous set up of the box legendary, to the side stories, is crafted with the utmost care and creativity. The battles feel weighty and intense, with challenging fights against your rivals, to the most difficult Champion in the series to date. The soundtrack is a highlight of the DS Era. Pokémon Platinum is also home to some of the best battle music in Pokémon.

The fourth generation of Pokémon saw the introduction of some fan favourites like Garchomp, Lucario, and Luxray to name a few. This generation also happens to include the most well designed set of starters of all of the entries in the series. In fact it generally has some of the best designs of the series period, as many different Pokémon from this generation are infamous amongst the fanbase. Looking at the legendary offerings alone shows the strength of Game Freaks design choices.

The game, being a third entry to the fourth generation games, capitalizes on this fact by correcting most of the issues the original releases of Diamond and Pearl were plagued by. It furthered this momentum by altering the story and providing an excellent build up and climax. Pokémon Platinum stands out amongst the series as an extremely well polished and carefully crafted experience worthy to be named one of the best of Game Freaks offerings."

Pokémon Platinum adds a modest amount of new content to the experience of Diamond and Pearl. An expanded final act for the story, more spotlight given to certain characters, a couple of new areas to explore and new additional facilities to visit after completing the main campaign, where players can test their skills in engaging challenging battles, fighting with handicaps or special variations. All of this makes Platinum the definitive Sinnoh experience for sure, but none of the additions are incredible enough to make a meaningful difference and none of the major issues of DP are resolved."

  ",9,"tl;dr this game is fun and good at the beginning and end, but falls off in the middle. fortunately for it the most important parts are the beginning and end. the elite four and champion are great and actually challenging, and you actually need to treat it like you are playing against a real person who understands the game mechanics well

i slept on gen 4 for so long and boy do i regret it. the leveling is a little off with really awkward jumps, meaning you have to grind for exp for a fair bit and the amount of status spamming golbats gets annoying after a while but damn... the elite four was great.
with the newer games, generally the best way to get through the elite four is using raw strength, and brining in the most powerful moves you have at your disposal. here though, you actually have to use strategy and think!! wow!!! probably because the tweaked teams have much better move sets, and the AI uses moves like calm mind to set up a sweeper. generally you need to try and not let them set up, giving the battle strategy and depth. for the first time ever, i set up screens and stealth rock outside of pvp. and to top it all off you have probably the best champion in the series.
if im completely honest when i was playing through the pokemon league, i had a big ass grin on my face the entire time.
it did get a bit stale towards the middle of the game though and there were definitely some big over sights. the team galactic bit after the 7th gym was really tedious. especially mount coronet and the distortion world. not only do you have to fight through tonnes of grunts with the same repetitive pokemon you also have to climb an entire mountain with tonnes of wild pokemon, including exploding gravelers. and if you dont have many items on you (which i didnt) you are incredibly **** once you reach the top of the mountain, you are met with a relatively easy double battle before you are thrust into the distortion world. i say ""thrust"", not because you dont have a choice, but because if you choose not to go in and go to the pokemon centre, you have to climb all the way back through the caves, up the mountain, through the other cave and all the way back through the distortion world. most people would rather not, so you dont have much of a choice. and also to make things even worse, you have a boss battle against cyrus, with his really op gyarados. this is made even worse by the fact that the exp share actually makes the game harder since it splits the total exp, not give the same amount to whoever is holding it. this means that all your pokemon will become pretty underleveled pretty quickly. many, including myself, didnt realise this until it was too late, so there i am with level 30 pokemon, up against a level 45 gyarados, with insane type coverage. i think it would have been a bit more convenient for the player if, if you died, you spawned right outside the distortion world. while that wouldnt necessarily make much sense, i dont think that matters too much since it would greatly reduce the overall pain that you suffer from trekking back up the mountain. my last and final issue with this game is how its completely rigged. i kid you not, the mother **** golbats never missed a confuse ray or supersonic and got poison from poison fang literally every single time. and there are like 200 of them. literally every grunt has a golbat. and they all do the exact same thing. just spam status moves. in fact the only real difficulty outside of boss battles is that status spams. its not fun. its not hard. its just really tedious. it forces you to waste turns spamming items, and all that does is make everything feel like it takes 10 times longer than it should. but yh back to the good stuff..

i have not played diamond and pearl, but what i can gather is that this game is basically dp, but  more challenging. the movesets of gymleaders are much more varied, and force you to not just spam their weakness. you need to work around and outsmart the AI. and also giritina is waaaaaaaaay cooler than dialga or palkia.

cynthia is a really good champion, her team is great and its genuinely a good fight. and its actually difficult. cant say that about most champions.

unfortunately like literally every single pokemon game ever, the rival does not compare to blue or silver. i suppose barry isnt really a rival, more like a friend you battle every now and again

i havent really dived into the post game content or the side content, like the contests or the underground tunnel things so i cant say too much about that, but i have heard good things about them, and a lot of people saying its the best in the series.

also a quick tip, luxray, starraptor, floatzel and garchomp are pretty dang good, they literally carried me through the pokemon league. you can get all of them pretty early and they are all really strong physical attackers, and are pretty fast. just dont make the same mistake as me and think that luxray was a special user"

  ",8,"Definitive version of the Sinnoh generation. The first generation of pokemon that had a decent OP. The region map is ok. She has great starters. And Sinnoh's Pokédex is good too.

Gameplay is slower than normal. Pokétch was a really cool addition. In the game there are also several moments when you pair with a character, I thought it was really cool. The twisted world was a cool puzzle and a nice addition to the story. Pokemon Platinum is a little more difficult than Diamond and Pearl and ends up being one of the most difficult in the franchise because some bosses have a high level gap (for Pokemon), have Berrys who recover their HP and use potions. Nothing too difficult but for the Pokemon standard the difficulty is quite high. You have very little freedom when choosing gyms (you can choose the order of 3 of them if I'm not mistaken).

The story in general and especially the beginning is very basic without anything innovative. The Looker is a very cool character, who added the story. Professor Pokemon had a lot of appearances in the story, they haven't changed much but overall it was ok. Cynthia appears at various times as well, but her appearances are quite random and only served to familiarize the protagonist with the champion of the region. Barry was an ok rival, with a cliché personality never before used in the franchise, he had a decent development during the journey. The villain, head of the Galactica team is an interesting villain but his motivation was very weak. The Galactica team is very dark (and very stupid), and had a specific moment when they made 3 legendary suffer to reach their goal that surprised me. In short the first half is as usual and the second is ok.

The soundtrack is one of the best and most diverse in the franchise."

Filling out the pokedex
catching swarms.

Possible Sinnoh Region Remake Improvements: +Faster and less boring game play. +New megas/alolan forms. +Mega/alolan Pokemon for gym leaders/rival/elite four/champion. Opinion on Sinnoh: Personally, Diamond/Pearl/Platinum are my least favorite Pokemon games because they were really forgettable. As some Pokemon were good, a ton of them were forgettable. The game felt like a chore as it felt so dragged on and really slow. The rival was really annoying and didn't have the almost villain yet good guy attitude as rivals like Hugh, Blue, and Silver. The gym leaders and elite four members were only hard for their leveling, otherwise, they were pushovers with their terrible Pokemon choices. Thankfully Pokemon Platinum changed up some of the lineups making them better yet still were not too applaudable. I liked Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum for the evil team the most - Team Galactic. They seemed pretty cool and I liked their themes. They were the one of the few evil teams that I didn't feel like they were handing me their whole secret plan in order for me to defeat them. I also think Cynthia is awesome with her diverse Pokemon choice and surprisingly strategic maneuvers for an AI. The special/physical split is also a huge plus as a competitive battler myself.

The music is solid, near-perfect midi work, and the story is your usual pokemon story. The antagonist party is pretty solid, though not the best (as of 2015). The graphics are your classic pokemon old-school graphics, before GEN6 arrived. I felt that the game slightly dragged at the 15 hour mark, but things picked up quickly afterwards. It's a game worth obtaining if you don't have it, and definitely is worth getting over Diamond AND Pearl (you can get both legendaries + Giratina).

  ",9,"I am The Destroyer. I will break games, complain about the littlest detail, and tell you whether or not you should buy this game. A lot of things to say but can't due to the 5000 character limit.

1. Story
The story follows Lucas (if you picked Male) or Dawn (if you picked Female) as they try to outdo their childhood friend, Barry, in completing the pokedex; and then eventually race each other to who can become Pokemon champion. As the player journeys along; they have to battle Gym Leaders, grow stronger with their Pokemon, and deal with a villainous organization called Galactic, who feel it is their right to alter the entire universe. Not much more plot can be given away without spoiling, but this story is going to take you by surprise.

2. Graphics and Visuals
Some of the animations for attacks feels like it's a step backwards, while some animations are a step forwards. Another confusion is how you'll see is how the graphics outside of battle look pixelated, but when you enter battle the graphics suddenly upgrade to console-worthy. Mostly unbalanced...

3. Gameplay
Gameplay refers to the Battle System, Customization & Level Up, and various areas you explore within the game. Put it all together and it's awesome!

-Battle System-
This is where you're gonna have the most fun. You'll begin the game with only one Pokemon of your choice. The only way to get more on your team is to catch them in the wild using Pokeballs. They'll be the only tool you can use for catching in the beginning,  but more variety will open up overtime. Be careful though, because if another trainer sees you outside of town they may challenge you to a Pokemon battle with no way for you to refuse.  When in battle, you have the choice of picking 1 of 4 moves, using an item, switching Pokemon, or running away (only works during wild encounters). To win a battle, you must deplete the HP of your foe's Pokemon through your Pokemon's moves. There will be plenty of battles to keep you on your toes.

-Customization-
The customization is there! You can build your team anyway you desire by choosing your Pokemon and their moves as they get stronger. There's also a few more customization options which you'll have to get far enough in the game to discover.

-Exploration-
The exploration is acceptable, but you'll get this feeling of sensation that there could have been more in terms of obstacles, puzzles, and even boss battles. Near the end, it will become bland & boring enough that you'll just want to speed-run over to the next town for your next badge.

4. Soundtrack
The soundtrack is above average. The music composers have really earned their phrase this time. You'll come back listening to more, and might even stop mid-game just to listen.

5. Personal Enjoyment
What I really love about Nintendo is that they know how to program their games. They also treat everyone by focussing on gameplay before story, so it makes it feel like it's worth your money when you do a second playthrough. And there's so much you can do in this game that it makes it worth every bit of your money. I got my 70 hours worth.
My only complaint is that Nintendo Wi-Fi was shut down since writing this review, so there's no more online play, making it very difficult to get any of the Pokemon who are required to be traded in order to evolve. I also dislike how you need GBA cartridges of other Pokemon games for specific Pokemon to appear in Platinum at all.

6. Overall Verdict
This game definitely holds replay value. It also manages to give you a satisfiying ending after all the hardwork put in. And that is why Pokemon Platinum deserves a 9 out of 10! This is the best game I've ever played for Nintendo DS thus far, and is a must-buy, especially for those people who have yet to move onto the next generation. Even then, Pokemon Platinum is a game that should be saved instead of destroyed."

  ",10,"Pokemon Platinum corrected many issues present in the previous installments Diamond and Pearl, like fixing the shortage of Pokemon (the Pokemon the Gym Leaders and Elite Four used in Diamond and Pearl were horrendous), and the game also runs faster, as opposed to the yawn-inducing processing times of the previous installments. There are nice additions onto the story from Diamond and Pearl as well, like new character appearances, making the story tighter and further clarifying the purpose/significance of the Legendary Pokemon. Likewise, there are plethora of new Pokemon, including those with new, fresh, and exciting cross-generational evolutions in the region's Pokedex - much more appropriate than the Pokedex in Diamond and Pearl.

Long story short, Platinum unlocked the fresh potential that Diamond and Pearl tossed out the window. An amazing game, especially if you have not played the previous versions."

This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.

The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.

The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.

Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section

The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections."

I mean, watch the intro cinematic! Another thing that makes this game good is the amount of awesome Pokemon in Gen 4: Infernape, Torterra, Garchomp, Lucario and Magnezone to name a few. Another good thing about this game is the amount of Pokemon you can catch in the main story is INCREDIBLE! That said, if you are a die hard Pokemon fan like me, pick it up.

Pokemon die-hards are used to only subtle remakes, and this, unfortunately, is yet another subtle one, but lets you enjoy that adventure again,but slightly different from last time."
