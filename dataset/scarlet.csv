Its sad to see what they are doing to the Pokémon franchise.
This game is way to easy because its open world, there is bugs everywhere, and my phone could run the game better.
This game would be better if it wasn't for the switch's limitations.
This game is a wake up call for Nintendo to release the next console."

  ",8,"( I played this game a bit after the actual release so my opinion is on the later versions). Pokémon scarlet/violet is generally a good game. It is definitely a great step into the right direction for future Pokémon games. Its open world is very expansive but has some flaws. When I was playing the game, I didn’t notice any major problems aside from some slight frame drops like in the large lake area in the north west . Even after completing the game and finishing the Pokédex, I didn’t have any visual or physical bugs aside from two small glitches, which didn’t affect my gameplay. While yes, the open world has flaws, I think it’s still amazing.  The story is nothing to scoff at as well, the characters are interesting and refreshing. The story keeps my attention and makes me actually want to see what happens next. I understand why it was released when it was, but I feel that Nintendo should just take their time to make games at full potential. I hope to see great things from the Nintendo company."

  ",8,"I rated this game an 8/10 because although the game is very fun and entertaining, there are still bugs in places. I didn’t get the game as soon as it came out, so I was not a part of the group of players who had to enjoy the game while it was virtually unplayable due to massive glitches, bugs, and extreme lag. Though even after many bug fixes, it does still lag a bit under certain conditions but not to the point where you cannot work around it. I have 200+ hours in the game after finishing it in its entirety and sometimes the lag in specific areas still annoys me but I have been thoroughly pleased by the outcome and the DLC only adds to that delight. Being only the second game I’ve owned of the franchise and coming after what I've heard be considered a groundbreaking approach to the game, I was still extremely satisfied."

Mas o que me faz da uma nota baixa assim são alguns problemas...primeiro devo admitir que drop de frame pode ser uma dor para alguns, mas para mim não foi a pior coisas....onde eu acho que o jogo mais me decepcionou foi em não aproveitar o mundo aberto com mais coisas para serem feitas o que faz o mundo parecer vazio( poderia ter aprendido com Zelda BoTW) além disso um outro fator que realmente me deixo louco foi a falta de uma dublagem, mano isso destruiu muito a imersão do jogo é estraga totalmente a narrativa, pelo menos para mim foi uma dor não ter dublagem e um outro problema que acontece que também é um porr é o bug de quando você entra na luta e não consegue ver seu pokemon...e para fechar chave de ouro o problema de otimização, que novamente como já falei antes poderia ter aprendido com o zelda. Comprando a preço promocional é um jogo que acaba valendo a pena"

I hink haven't had a good experience witha Pokémon games since Black and White 2, this game made me fell in love again withthe franchise and even with all their faults I had an incredible experiencez there are som many things to do and now it's bug free, so you can play it really well, the only thing is the fps drops but it's not that big of a deal, I’ll always wish that Game Freak had taken another year or maybe even just a few more months to polish it enough to be playablefrom the start."

Then there is the boring empty open world, which is nice to see the first time only to realise there is barely anything of interest. The towns are empty shells. There are basically no side quests, you cannot enter any houses excerpt like 5. The gameplay is there somewhere and the pokemon models look awesome. But this is not enough and the game is an unfinished mess we all payed for. Some twice. Gamefreak / Nintendo promised to fix something, but nothing happened a year after release. I hope they are all ashamed. Isure am for playing this."

  ",1,"This game is nothing more than a diversion. The only reason to even buy this game is if you are a Pokémon fanatic and absolutely MUST capture the new 80 or so goofballs the minds of Game Freak designed.

Although, let's consider that I myself AM a Pokémaniac.
I STILL don't think buying this game is justified, let alone its existence as a whopping *$60* game.

7 years ago, I got a copy of Pokémon Sun (gen 7) at Walmart with my birthday money. It was clear that Game Freak wanted players to remember that game with a bright smile, as Sun and Moon only has missed opportunities, not major issues; for a 3DS game it looked stunning with some areas even having cinematic camera angles for you to find, the post-game content was excellent, and the base game was the hardest a Pokémon title has ever been; with boss battles using weather, status moves, abilities, and gimmicks to their complete advantage.
And while I won't write an essay on it, the story was touching. A nice deviation from the typical optimistic ""stop evil team and become champion"" trope the franchise welded itself to for so long. Only the Unova duology has topped its story.

This is where Game Freak reached their magnum opus and crafted art, rather than just ""a game""
Which is why this entry in the series is even more disappointing for me than the embarrassment that is Sword and Shield and BDSP.

First off, Dex-it is back from SWSH and BDSP; we all know the spiel of that. But in my opinion, Dex-it in this game is even *worse.*
There are some fan-favorite Pokémon such as Absol, Gigalith, Steelix and Aegislash who are not present, and it is jarring to see icons so beloved by children and adults be completely sidelined, not even alluding to them. But what stings even more is the removal of the Eternal 3; a group of Pokémon I dubbed that name due them being in every game since Red and Green; the families of Machamp, Alakazam, and Crobat. The absence of these Pokémon isn't just heart-breaking, but also feels illogical. No one in the Pokémon fanbase could even IMAGINE a game without those 3 showing up. Their disinclusion leaves an awful hole in the game. 

Another issue I have is the shallow main-game. The story this time is divided into 3 smaller stories, which merge together after completing all of them. While this is a cute idea and is a concept i would be curious to see in a BETTER game, this just results in a wild goose chase across the map, except you eventually DO catch the goose. Its just so awkward; the lack of routes and distinct locations that previous games used to merge point A and point B together hurts this style of story progression a lot. I often got frustrated at trying to find my next location or trying to scale a mere rock. And again, I can't stress how much those distinct locations in the earlier games fleshed the journey out; not only did they indeed merge A and B together, but some areas even adopted clever gimmicks, such as floating stones that you move around, deserts with a hidden exit, or an abandoned hotel that requires you to access both the North and South side to 100% the area. The lack of any cool landmarks makes the journey lame and bland. 
And post game? Uhhh there IS none! I guess the Battle Tower and secret post-game locations were just too awesome to bring back, jeez...

The game is also far from hard. While some trainers do use items (held items, at that), they often use very abysmal Pokémon in combat with very poor moves; a Hypno with a Life Orb is still a sad, weak Hypno. The conclusion of the game is somehow even MORE pathetic. The Elite 4's teams are awful, and Geeta's team was so unacceptable that Game Freak UPDATED HER TEAM in post-game after ver. 2.0.. Yes, it was SO BAD that they had to ALTER her team. Unlike Sun and Moon, the boss battles don't feel like challenges with strategy to imply; team members often fail to play to their strengths and the moves that they are able to learn, and everyone online memes at the fact that Geeta's last Pokémon was designed to be setup fodder, the opposite of your final ace in the hole.

And finally... this looks awful. People are saying this looks like a GameCube game, but that is an absolute insult to the GameCube. THAT console could actually render impressive lighting, shadows, and visual effects like heat-wave. The graphics were also decent; Super Mario Sunshine and The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess still look good today. And the system could even withstand loading in 128 AI units at once.

This game cannot render it's lighting and shadows properly. Its graphics are garbage and sometimes seem to glitch out. And I don't think the game can even handle *50* units on screen at once. Heck, having more than even 5 units on screen already makes it quiver a bit.


None of this is even the 1080p console's fault; this game was made with NO heart put into it and was ONLY made to be a cash-grab as ""the 21st game iteration of the highest grossing media franchise of the 21st century"". WOW."

  ",7,"Tras una decepcionante octava generación, Game Freak decidió basar la nueva generación de Pokémon en España, creando la región de Paldea. Este mundo abierto en el que me he sumergido durante 35 horas posee grandes zonas explorables con relieve lo que otorga al juego de una gran verticalidad, y gracias a la montura (legendario del juego) se ha conseguido que la exploración sea bastante satisfactoria. A esto ayuda que los Pokémon estén campando por las distintas áreas y hace que el mundo esté vivo. A su vez quiero destacar la nueva opción de pelear con el Pokémon que hayas sacado, ya que da dinamismo y una pizca de inmersión. En cambio, lo peor del mapa sin duda son sus ciudades, carentes de profundidad y originalidad y actuando como meros escaparates de los gimnasios, un punto muy decepcionante. Estos, a su vez, poseen líderes carismáticos y me ha gustado el papel que desempeña cada uno en su ciudad. En cuanto a la historia, me ha parecido correcta y bastante aceptable para lo que acostumbramos con esta saga, partiendo de tres historias distintas que podemos seguir con el orden que queramos (esto ha permitido dar una gran sensación de libertad) y que concluyen en un gran arco final. La jugabilidad sigue siendo el punto fuerte de Pokémon, combatir es muy divertido y los nuevos añadidos a este juego como la teracristalización abre un mundo de posibilidades de cara al competitivo. La cámara de los combates otorga más inmersión que en otros juegos de la saga pero es mejorable. El multijugador está bastante bien implementado y me ha gustado mucho. La banda sonora es buena, destacando sobre todo algunos combates con canciones que van a pasar a la historia. Llegando a qué es sin duda el punto más débil del juego, debo comentar que yo he jugado en portátil por lo que no he notado tanto la baja calidad gráfica. Igualmente, técnicamente este juego es de lo peor que se ha sacado últimamente, siendo muy deficiente para una compañía como es Game Freak. Bajones de FPS, un popping exagerado y que te saca del juego, y una calidad gráfica impropia a la altura a la que estamos. Desgraciadamente, empaña mucho la experiencia. El apartado artístico no es muy destacable tampoco pero no está mal. Por último quiero comentar que la Pokedex tiene algunos Pokémon bastante originales y que me han gustado, pero otros diseños a mí parecer son horribles. También, el postgame me ha parecido bastante cutre. En conclusión, Pokémon Escarlata ha aportado cosas nuevas a la saga y ha conseguido con su historia y su forma de juego que se convierta en una buena experiencia para los fans, pero tiene numerosos problemas que no le permiten brillar y sigue quedándose un paso atrás de los juegos de antaño de la saga. Recomendado para los fans de Pokémon. 7,4/10 (01/2024)"

But that feeling quickly disappeared since I realized all of pokémon quests are just repetition from first quest... And it is really sad because this game could be really something! Generally speaking I had good time with this game but at the end I was so bored and frustrated because all of that dull repetitions and amazingly boring and stupid quest lines... I wish that they cold add skippable conversations because those are way to long! And why there isn't any voice acting?

  ",8,"I didn't play this on release, so a lot of the potential performance issues experienced were very minimal and more so limited to specific areas of the game. Other than that, I found myself enjoying this title far more than previous ones in many ways. The quality of life improvements from previous entries is significant for those who play more than the initial game. There is a very achievable and manageable endgame for both Competitive Pokemon, and Raids. (PVP and PVE.) The story was shockingly deep and well done, keep in mind this is a presentation for someone more teen-aged. It covers more complex topics that an audience that age could tackle with on a daily basis, while delivering the reliable ""feel-good"" moral message that Nintendo always does.

The new entries Pokemon wise are about average, there is roughly as many ""cool"" new ones as there are ""uninspired"" ones. But, to some extent that is expected as we're now beyond 1,000. 

A number of mechanical improvements, and some level of open world exploration is enjoyable and fun to navigate around. We are closely approaching a way to enjoy a true open world main entry for Pokemon. 

The DLC has been solid so far, about what you should expect for some extra content. 

Overall, it's a safe step forward. While we can agree that we want to see GameFreak be a bit more daring in the future, I cannot say that any parts of this game were particularly disappointing in any way. There are measurable improvements in many aspects of the game, from co-op, to gym progression, to story delivery, to end game PVP and PVE accessibility, and many more.

The one thing I would criticise, and it's more of a stylistic choice than actual mechanical issue is the new ""Terastalize"" mechanic. I just think it visually looks awful in comparison to Gigantamax or Mega Evolutions. Mechanically it's function is enjoyable and fresh, but visually it is just very unenjoyable."

It has high highs and very low lows. The performance is by far the worst part, so getting around that allows for the discovery of an actual game, not a great one, but a pretty decent game. The story is unexpectedly phenomenal and gives generation five a run for its money. The characters are some of the best the series has seen, and the new Pokemon are pretty average overall. There are some really goods ones as well as some forgettable ones. Everything else stylistic of Pokemon like the music and dialogue remain pretty strong. Overlooking the awful performance and glitches make Pokemon Scarlet a good game, but since no one can overlook those troublesome things, it deserves an average rating."

  ",7,"A game that is carried by a formula that has not been worn by the ages. The Pokémon gameplay loop, fundamentally, is fun. The designs, as always, are top notch and the story, though alright at best compared to the industry as a whole, is very good for a Pokémon game, however that isn't saying very much. The gameplay of catching creatures both new and old is as always fun, and going through the gyms and becoming champions is as entertaining as it was in the earlier entries.

However, this game is riddled by gameplay bugs, poor optimisation and mediocre graphics, especially when compared to the early games on it's system, primarily The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The areas are boring and empty, with the non-story related characters being as bland as the area they're set in. The game is fairly easy to finish if you have any experience in the series, and I doubt would put up much of a challenge even  if you don't.

Despite all this, I cant stop but enjoy this game. It's clunky mechanics made up for by the foundation made by the stronger games before it. I find it hard to recommend this game over other games in the series, such as Legends Arceus on the same system, or other games in the genre such as Monster Sanctuary, but I cannot deny that the game, at it's core, is fun to play, and also has an amazing soundtrack (as most Pokémon games do). the best thing I can say about this game is that I believe that it has laid the foundation for Pokémon to create something truly special, now that they have become familiar with the open world genre."

  ",2,"A showcase of horrendous optimization. I love the Pokémon formula and have played every generation since the original Blue/Red, but although I, in theory, like what Scarlet brings to the table, with its open world and whatnot, the actual game has extreme performance issues, to the point where it could barely even be seen as acceptable as an early access title, let alone a finished product. I've experienced several random crashes leading to lost progress, the framerate frequently dips into single digits (sometimes throughout entire areas) and rarely goes above 20 fps, there are stutters that are so long it seems like the game has actually frozen, there's a ton of pop-in both in terms of terrain and pokémon (which will often spawn right on top of you, initiating battle immediately without giving you any chance to react), and so on and so forth. This is quite possibly the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. Yes, the Switch hardware is weak, but other developers manage to counteract that in various ways. Meanwhile, Game Freak just went ""Meh, who cares?"" and have to my knowledge not released a single performance patch in the 14 months that have gone by since the release. It's glaringly evident that they don't give a crap whatsoever about what the players think. This is even more evident when you consider the fact that they're still to this day releasing two nearly identical games every new generation, just to urge players to buy them both for full price to access the few pokémon that are exclusive to each version. If any other company did something similar, they'd get flak for it like there's no tomorrow, but people have somehow been brainwashed to think it's fine when it's Pokémon. Pokémon Scarlet is a disappointing, broken game that will most likely remain so permanently due to the developer's clear disinterest in improving the situation."

Storywise and gameplaywise, it's a masterpiece. The whole game is a mystery. And the end of the game is the most entertaining ending in a pokemon game. Pokemon designs are cool and clearly inspired, not necessarily ""just designed to be plushes"". The designs have a lot going for them. This game is way underrated. The only bad thing that you'll run into is frame rate issues. I have to admit, that was a huge problem. However, if you can look past these performance issues, you'll be able to enjoy the game and it's clever story for what it's worth. The characters are very relatable and have their own unique personalities too, which will probably make you more intrigued and interested to see what happens in the story.

However, if you ignore the technical issues, go through the different gyms and bosses in ascending order, and try to only use Pokemon of the same level as the respective gyms, this is the best Pokemon game of all time.
The open world is great. The feeling of exploring the world, discovering items, new Pokemon and NPCs is amazing. Annoying random encounters have been removed. And there have been a bunch of quality of life changes that make the game significantly less grindy. The new Terastalizing mechanic makes battles even more interesting.
All in all, the core gameplay loop of catching Pokemon and building teams has never been as fun as in this game, especially if the player takes some steps to ensure that things go in the right order and are not too easy. There is something in the classic linear top-down games that gives them life and coziness that are not present here. But still, this is a very good Pokemon game!"

However, Gamefreak's mishandling of the Pokémon franchise has become intolerable for me. The character designs seem to have lost their essence with each generation, replaced by a simplistic and brash American animation style. The portrayal of geometric shapes and bold lines renders the new Pokémon utterly unappealing, making it hard to imagine them as vivid creatures thriving in the natural world! The subpar game production, modelling, and, even worse, the rendering continues to disappoint. Scarlet and Violet mark the first time in my personal history that I haven't purchased a Pokémon main series game at launch, and I genuinely have no desire to support Pokémon's core games if Gamefreak continues to misuse the franchise. They risk losing a loyal fan who has followed them for decades if they persist in this manner."

BUT
Unfortunately it feels so lifeless and half baked. Cities and villages aren’t really towns no more. U can’t even enter buildings, can’t talk to many NPCs just to a few which is very depressin cuz it doesn’t feel like an RPG nor a Pokémon game to me tbh. Yes it’s an open world game but it was not well conceived so some routes are too eazy or too difficult dependin on ur ingame progress. Sad cuz I’m a huge Pokémon fan since day one. The stories of the main game and the DLCs are really awesome and for me one of the best at all but most of the features of the DLCs coulda been implemented in the main game and shouldn't be sold as extra context. Hopin for the next gen/game to be better tho."

  ",3,"I got Red version and a Game Boy Color for Christmas in 1996. I have played Pokémon ever since. The last Great games were Black and White.  Black 2 and White 2 were re-hashed trash. Then with the change to ""3D"" in X and Y things started going south.

These most recent iterations are my least favorite.  The ""open world"" is a little too open.  As in there's not really much there.  The way your Pokémon battle and gain experience almost seems like a FF game - there's really no explanation about leveling. I'm playing Brilliant Diamond right now (I took a long Pokémon hiatus after X and Y) and I like how it shows you your stats when you level up.  The new games don't talk about stats at all. Everyone gets equal EXP (which I know is not new to these games - I'm not sure how I feel about it).

The red-roofed Pokémon centers and blue-roofed Poké Marts are gone.  Now there's a sing ugly pop-up cart like those things at the mall that sell stuff but don't have an actual store - just a stand in the middle of the aisle.

I do like how you can transfer Pokémon from team to boxes without being at the Pokémart.  This makes sense because of the technology we have now.  Even though it wasn't really that inconvenient before.

I have beaten two gym leaders and the ""challenges"" I had to do first were stupid.  They were already good before.  You were in a gym building of a certain type with that guy at the door who told you what kinda gym it was and then the diff trainers you had to get past to get to the gym leader.  Now you can skip the trainers completely and just do some dumb activity that doesn't really help you level for the gym leader.  I guess they figure you don't need to level cuz of the v generous exp share.

Idk what's up with the ""Team Whoever"" but they don't seem that bad yet.  Maybe I'll meet the real sinister characters later.

The UI is trash and slow af.  The FPS is equally ****.

I love Pokémon and will ofc have to Catch 'em All, but wth.  The Diamond/Pearl remakes are good.  GameFreak - please go back to the older style and not this 3d open world thing."

We need, like, the 3DS game option for fast battles or Skip Tera animations.... especially for double battles.    * Glitches and bugs when touching ground with your travel pokemon. For example, stuck in mountains or rocks, you can't move or jump until the game detects you are glitched and teleports you to another location.    * I will give 1 score this time and not 0 because the BBQ Quests are a cool feature. The farming is a little bit grinding, but at least they added something you spend time on after the Horrible short story.Conclusion, buy on Sales or if you Urge to play a pokemon game.

Open world makes certain areas forgettable and the cities are uninteresting to explore, open world was bare but i think that's fine for this game as the landscapes are good and you will mainly just be focused on finding new pokemon. Story had little interesting moments and the legendaries felt less ""legendary"" and more just like normal pokemon, gyms don't scale to your current pokemons levels which ruins the point of doing gyms in any order. Shiny hunting is one of the better features in this game as it's fun and has good spawn rates to keep it interesting. Game has many bugs i encountered, for example, a bug where when my pokemon was in battle it would sink into the floor or a glitch where my koraidon would get stuck in the floor for a few seconds. The champion was also really easy and uninteresting just like most the other characters.

  ",3,"While it's evident that Game Freak intended to expand the fans' experience, it is very evident that they did so against their better judgement and nature. Game Freak has never liked too much change in their gaming design and with the recent complaints about Sword and Shield they obviously tried to give the fans some things that they were asking for. Unfortunately, the lack of passion shines through. There is a palpable lack of trust of critical fans' feedback. Playing these games feels as if the critiques of Sword and Shield and Legends Arceus were more of a nuisance in Game Freak's ear than a real change in direction or philosophy. The games actively feel like a half-baked attempt at appeasing the complaints while delivering the age old Pokemon experience. But, neither satisfy what players have been waiting for for several years. Another generation of Pokemon becomes yet another missed opportunity to reinvent, reinvigorate, and renew the Pokemon experience and world. The story has several plot holes (even though Game Freak has never really been lauded for their story-telling, I'll admit) and follows the same story beats as every preceding game before them. The gym challenge, Titan Pokemon, and Team Star quests are almost complete carbon copies of previous story's with slightly modified mechanics. Scarlet and Violet don't have any notable or standout story beats that haven't been done in one way or another by a Pokmeon game before. While some of the lore behind certain parts of the quests may be intriguing it is quickly dropped and abandoned as the next story beat moves along. The story feels as cookie-cutter/copy-and-past as ever. 

Performance issues run amuck even after a year of patches and DLC updates. The games are the absolute worst running games I've ever played, personally. And the lack of attempt to improve the playing experience is really disappointing as a long time Pokemon fan. So much so that I can't bring myself to play them even out of boredom due to the extreme frustration I feel from trying to just move around the map.

Pokemon, characters, and environments glitch constantly. Lighting effects flash in an out as the camera moves. Character models move out of bounds or through the environment and sometimes prevent catching and battling. The frame-rate drops all the time. ALL THE TIME. It becomes a chore just to move across the open-world map (which doesn't even look that good which is the baffling part). The world is barren and when Pokemon spawn it is more often than not pop-in from a VERY short distance from the camera and player character. 

I could go on and on. I have been a Pokemon fan for decades and this is by far the worst game I've played due to performance and lack of fixes. The Pokmeon Company's internal care of profit over product is publicly available for all to see in these titles. I feel ripped off by having bought these games at full price, and it has soured the Pokemon experience so badly that I will watch other people play future games online because I'd rather watch someone else play these games than spend any more of my own money on a product I can't trust anymore. 

The vision is always there. But, the execution has recently faltered more and more. I can't keep looking at the small steps Game Freak has made when they make huge leaps backwards in the basics of gaming mechanics and experiences."

The music is also fantastic, my favourite being the final boss. It's not without it's flaws though, the most prominent being the frame rate drops and occasional glitches, although that didn't take away the fun I had playing this game, but I understand how it could be a deal breaker for some.

Overall it's a step in the right direction, and I hope Game Freak can fix the frame rate issues and glitches in future games, because if there weren't any performance issues, this would be close to a 10. Highly recommend if you're a fan of Pokemon, and if you don't mind occasional frame rate drops and glitches"

Oh hey, you can't even enter 80% of the buildings in the cities anymore. The cities in general mostly lack any type of background information or lore. What's the point of exploring a soulless, empty-feeling world with graphics that are worse than most games I have on my Nintendo ds from almost 2 decades ago.
I will give it one thing though, the Pokemon walking next to you was a nice change. Oh wait, they didnt even come up with that, that already was a thing in Pokemon Soulsilver (the best pkm game ever in my opinion), except they gave the Pokemon actual dialogue and reactions that made them feel like your own little pets. The only thing I could come up with that was unique and cute were the picnics.

However, the graphical and performance issues I witnessed in this game were honestly detrimental to my opinion of Nintendo's general seal of quality. Who is letting these games get out the door? Background textures from the GameCube era set with standard character models for the Switch that use animations that were barely excusable on the 3DS is the kind of half-assed work that screams this game was kicked out the door and abandoned. It's kind of sad honestly.
Music is about where it should be. The story itself is alright, but story battles designed for a 5 year old struggling with the type chart when the average player is over 20 is indicative that the difficulty settings that were almost correctly implemented 10+ years ago are just forgotten. The Pokemon League leaves players making theories of why the ""champion"" has the tools of a winner (kind of), and the strategy of a drooling baby with a controller. Difficulty is only artificially generated by the player with no options to make it so. 
If you're hoping the DLC is any better, it isn't. Just some pay to win options for PvP, and an area slightly better than the base game overworld. As someone who has held these low views of the game since launch, I am ashamed to have paid for it. I would like less of the games, and some semblance of quality. Please."

In reality, my score would be something like a 3/10 as the game does have redeeming factors, but I feel inclined to give this score simply because of how insulting it is by GameFreak and to anyone and everyone who likes Pokemon. The game tries on a new open world approach and while on the surface, it seems to be an excellent idea, the execution is extremely poor as gyms still have pre-determined levels meaning that the game isn't so much ""open world"", there is still an intended path for the player to go on, except this time the game doesn't tell you what that path is. Additionally, the world is extremely empty and there is nothing to do in between gyms, team star bases and the titans, all of the towns feel soulless and empty and the game lacks an identity as a whole, this game is supposed to be based on Spain but shares no resemblance. The pokemon designs are quite boring and lazy too, lacking identity and being a massive downgrade from gen 8's designs which were already a downgrade in and of itself. The story, once again, is excellent on paper but the execution is very poor, as I have no attachment to the characters and feel bored whenever there is a cutscene going on, because the game loves to drag. I've beaten this game once solo and tried playing a second time but instead with a friend alongside me and I will admit that the multiplayer feature is an excellent addition, but only because it allowed us to play the game freely and do what we wanted to have fun. However, when we decided to play the actual game and stopped goofing around, the story was tediously boring and ultimately we quit before the third gym because we didn't want to sit through more of what was at the end of the day, a really bad game."

  ",2,"I rarely get so polarized by a video game that I have the wherewithal to bother to leave a public review of it, and this is one of those times. This game is a radioactive dumpster fire. I will break each element down in excruciating detail:

Graphics - being that this will be the first thing you notice about the game I'll put it first. Conveniently it's also one of the most egregious things about this game. The character models and textures - both main characters and pokemon - are actually fine, but the environment looks like it was thrown together in Blender by a team of unpaid interns in five months. The environmental textures are horrendous, repetitive, and low resolution. Mountains look like ugly wads of mud. Building exteriors have some charm, but you can't enter almost any of them. Visual glitches of any and every kind abound, from lighting flickering on and off, characters and entire sections of environment blinking in and out of existence randomly, and models switching to very noticeable diminished levels of detail if you are more than ten feet away. Animations for both people and pokemon are also stiff and lifeless except in one or two clearly pre-rendered cutscenes.

Performance - By now everybody knows the framerate is garbage and that the speed is tied to the framerate, which means essentially that the game runs in slow motion. Exacerbating this is the fact that the motion controls on the mount are janky and the camera is terrible. Even in battles the framerate sometimes drops to unacceptable levels, despite battles using the same turn based mechanics from the Game Boy from 30 years ago. It is a genuinely astounding feat of engineering to make a game that already makes so few demands on the graphical rendering capacity of the Switch to *also* run this badly.

Story - To say that this ends up having one of the better stories (at least in the final act) of any modern game in the series is such a low bar that you could use it for limbo. There are two main characters who have anything even remotely interesting going on and only one by the climax. Nemona is a total bore. Penny's story isn't terrible but extremely predictable. Arvin's is in my opinion the best but it's still not enough to compensate for the rest of this paint-by-numbers snoozefest.

It's become a cliche at this point, but it really must be emphasized that pokemon is the highest grossing media IP of all time. Yes, it mostly comes from merchandise. Yes, the games set the schedule for all other products. No, none of this excuses the horrendous state of modern pokemon games. It is well past time that people stop letting this terrible terrible company get away with selling such inferior, unfinished software."

  ",2,"Summary: This game is a WIP that the developers should have presented as a proof of concept, and definately not a purchasable (finished???) product. In no way is this finished. It feels like one of those ripoff games you see being advertised on Google Play called 'Monster Capture Story' or whatever else they can get away with.

The only difference is that this game is legally allowed to use the pokemon IP. (Even if they shouldn't)

It needs polish, better craftmanship and care for the world they've created over all these years. My biggest worry is nothing will improve, they'll settle for this lacking standard because it sells. Please just stop buying it until they get their **** together. Because that's what I'm doing from now on.

Gym battles are less fun than watching paint dry
Bad story pacing even though you have a choice

However, the map is bland and I always have to use the destination marker to know where I am going which gets annonying. Plus there is lag sometimes. Furthermore, the elite four is too easy and not that challenging. Scarlet and Violet elite four is like Pokemon X and Y elite four.

  ",7,"As far as Pokémon games go it was fun. The school setting was brilliant, the characters are some of the most memorable to me since Gen IV, and the setting of Paldea is probably one of my most favorite Pokémon regions. The 3 main questlines, and free roaming of the map is also a welcome change over the old stories that were more linear. I liked the new Pokémon as well. The battling is fun as usual, and I love that all the Pokémon are running around in the world.

When I think about it, I really like the game, but it's held back by some really aggravating choices by the developers. Chief among these issues is the graphics, they are terrible. Character and Pokemon models are generally fine, but most of the textures are downright awful, characters and pokemon really close to you walk at like 5 FPS and the pop in is obnoxious. I actually think SwSh had better graphics than S/V, or at least they were more consistent and the issues less noticeable. A lot of people complained about FPS drops and bugs but neither of these were much of a problem for me. I never experienced a crash, and the FPS drops were noticeable but never lasted for very long and didn't impact my enjoyment of the game. When I see games like TOTK, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, DQXIS, etc. running on the Switch and looking great, it really makes me angry that this game looks so bad and has such obvious graphical problems.

I also wished they incorporated the Legends Arceus style of catching and battling, as that was more fast paced and fun. It's another aggravating decision by the developers, as the technology already exists and has already been applied to another Pokemon game and proven to work... it's just strange that they didn't add it to this game.

So yeah, I actually really enjoy this game, but I can't give it more than a 7 with all the obvious cut corners that the development team made to get it out. It's a fun game, no doubt held back by executives pushing tight release windows on the development team. 7/10"

Legends Arceus had a better Catching system. LA also had a better shopping setup where you can zoom in on said products, & plenty of clothes & merch to buy! Here you buy no clothes at all. Legends Arceus also had a better map system, you can only mark one spot on here vs alot in LA. This one has no markers ! The map is not good.

I have been playing the games for 3 hours but am totally underwhelmed and in my opinion, the game is still far away from fixed. I have played all Pokemon main series and this is the first one that I feel offended. First, the graphics is a downgrade from shield and I feel like I am playing a 3DS game on switch. Everything looks really bad (e.g. shadow, walls, houses, you name it). I don't mind graphics that much if the gameplay is smooth. However, the game also suffers from numerous performance issues. Second, the developers are being lazy. For most houses in towns, you cannot enter them as in previous games, and for most stores in towns/cities, you cannot enter them either -- you are simply shown a list of items that you can buy, and there are only very few NPCs who you can talk to. They don't even bother to design the simple dialogues. This level of laziness is unbelievable. Third, the control design is really bad. Whenever I leave some stores or finish talking to someone, I usually end up with stealth mode because of pressing B buttons. This is so stupid. Additionally, the camera rotates in a way that is so uncomfortable and makes you nauseous. I am easily addicted to games but this is the first game that I have self-control. After playing 3 hours, I am able to stop and tell myself -- ok, that is too much for today, which shows how lackluster it is. I do like the design of new Pokemons but the game was released too soon -- they should give themselves at least two more years and bring us the best game experience."

It honestly astounds me how low the user score is, because both games have some huge QoL improvements over previous generations, massive replayability, and overall great gameplay. The open world aspect feels very fluid and an amazing change of pace that will hopefully continue forward. I'm trying  to give as fair of a review as possible; and the only reason I'm deducting the point is due to tera raids having their issues (which is ultimately a limitation of a time based battle with multiple animations going across several players at once); but these are still playable and still a huge draw for me back into the games month to month with their ongoing event raids."

  ",7,"Scarlet and Violet are very difficult games to rate. It some ways, they represent the lowest point of the series, such as the many performance issues that pretty much ruin any possibility of the world being immersive. And performance issues aside, the game is still pretty ugly, being completely outclassed by nearly every other 3D adventure game in the modern day, including lots of indie ones. The music is also a relative low point for the series, as there is not much memorable here aside from a few standout tracks that unfortunately do not come until late into the game. All that being said, I still think this game is worth checking out for any fan of the series, provided you can look past the huge performance issues. The layout and formula of the game works better than ever before, and I found it more fun to explore the world and catch Pokemon than ever before. The open world structure definitely could have been done better, as you are heavily discouraged from breaking too far off of the intended order of events. The story is a big step up from almost every other Pokemon game in my opinion, but it is still just okay overall. There are a good amount of characters that are at least somewhat interesting, but I found one of the three main plots of the game was extremely bland to the point where I completely stopped paying attention. That being said, the ending of the game is very strong, to the point where it was somewhat easy to forget the boring parts before that. As far as the new Pokemon go, I think there are a lot of great and fresh additions. The game still suffers from a lot of issues that have been plaguing the series since the Gen 1, namely dumb trainer AI and the game being way too easy in general. There is a big decrease in the number of required filler trainer battles, however, and I believe it works strongly to the games benefit. The end result is a game that is generally a lot more engaging than any entry since Gen 5. Overall, while there is a lot here to criticize, I still believe that at its core, this is the best Pokemon has been in quite a while. That's why it is such a shame that this return to form has been completely wasted by an embarrassing amount of technical problems and overall presentation issues."

  ",4,"Con ""Pokemon Scarlatto e Violetto"",Game Freak ha provato a portare una boccata d'aria fresca al franchise con la creazione del primo gioco di Pokemon **** volontà di creare un gioco del genere si riscontra già nei DLC di ""Pokemon Spada e Scudo"" e ""Pokemon Leggende Arceus"".
Trovo che la soluzione Open-World di Pokemon come un possibile futuro della serie,come già in Leggende Arceus,trovo molto divertente girovagare per la determinata regione in ""liberta"".
Passando a quello che troviamo nel gioco:
Il mondo Pokemon non è mai stato così tanto curato negli ultimi **** soltanto della teoria,la storia della regione,delle persone più influenti e dell'accademia del gioco sono curatissime e ben spiegate tra i dialoghi deli NPC  e varie lezioni e libri accademici ma è accompagnato dal peggior mondo Pokemon creato al livello tecnico-grafico,graficamente al livello di Pokemon Leggende Arceus.
Per farla breve,se stilassimo una lista dei punti positivi e negativi di Pokemon Scarlatto e Violetto otterremo:
Punti Positivi:
•Innovazione per il primo gioco open-world,funziona e diverte.
•Maggiore cura delle texture,modelli e animazioni dei Pokèmon.
•Una flora molto poco più presente e curata di LPA,ma almeno più presente.
•Ottime spiegazioni dei **** mondo in cui ti trovi e delle varie dinamiche,spesso queste informazioni le trovi nell'accademia di riferimento che rende sensato l'esistenza di essa.
•La Teracrystal la meccanica di questa generazione,per quanto esteticamente possa non piacere è contestualizzata bene nella regione,diverte usarla e può creare un nuovo competitivo interessante.
•Primo gioco Pokemon con più di una storia,anche se parallele e indipendenti l'una da l'altra ma riescono ad intrecciarsi bene tra di loro.
•Citazioni ad eventi di giochi passati che rende più reale il macro-mondo pokemon.
•Gameplay ibrido tra Pokemon Spada e Scudo e LPA.
•Mantentimento di alcune features di LPA e altri titoli come le cavalcature Pokemon (Presenti anche in Sole/Luna),la possibilità di cambiare le mosse del proprio pokemon a piacimento senza interruzioni o NPC di qualche tipo (Come in LPA) e la possibilità di cambiare il sopranome del pokemon dal menù pokemon (Come nei let's Go).
•Le funzioni multigiocatore sono ok,molto meglio di Pokemon Spada e Scudo.
•La presenza della cura automatica è un ottima aggiunta.
•La modalità ""vai a avanti"" (ENG:Lets Go) è interessante e utile per farmare xp e drops dei pokemon.

Ma ora arriviamo alla parte dolente,i punti negativi:
•Graficamente scadente per essere un titolo tripla-A.Texture ambientali a risoluzione bassissima.
•Il frame-rate,scarso e instabile. Il gioco spesso lagga e scatta.
•Presenza di troppi bug,spesso solo visivi. Con la telecamera puoi attraverare i muri,le roccie e le montagne. I pokemon spesso sono conpenetrati nel pavimento o nei muri,non sempre il gioco riesce a comprendere il pavimento durante una cattura e la pokeball rimane sospesa a mezz'aria e durante ""l'evoluzione dal vivo"" dato se il gioco non riconosce il pavimento,dunque parte l'evoluzione standard che abbiamo visto in tutti gli altri titoli.
•Il pokedex è uno spoiler vivente,se affronti un NPC e perdi ti registra nel Pokedex anche i pokemon che non hai visto,quando guardi il pokedex spesso si bugga e vedi i modelli di pokemon che non hai visto,la modalità ""note trovate di recente"" fa vedere le silhouette di vari pokemon,anche leggendari ed esclusivi (paradox compresi).
•La modalità ""stealth"" è inutile,i pokemon ti vedono e ti sentono lo stesso (In LPA funzionava bene).
•La mira spesso non funziona neache ad 1 mentro dal pokemon (Anche questa funzionava bene in LPA).
•Si sente l'assenza di lanciare le pokeball come in LPA.
•Personalmente i Raid li rintengo inferirori a quelli di Pokemon Spada e Scudo,il fattore tempo invece che turni è un idea stupida,ma le IA dei bot forse sono leggermente meglio.
•Le città più piccole del normale,può essere ok,ma con 0 case interaggibili,gli shop sono menù e non stanze.
•Spesso riesci ad attraversare alberi,cristalli dei raid e pokemon.
•Il box lagga e non carica velocemente i modelli dei pokemon.
•La cura automatica non riconosce le ricariche totali come items di cura e non ti permette di rianimare i pokemon.
•Gli oggetti sembrano piazzati in maniera randomica
•Anche se il motto di questi giochi è ""esplora come vuoi"",puoi farlo ma non è presente uno bilanciamento nei livelli delle **** percorri tutta la zone est di Paldea quando arriverai ad ovest con i Pokemon al lvl50 la palestra sarà al 20.
•Extra:Primo gioco pokemon dove sento la necessità di un doppiaggio,ma manca.
-------
Capisco le varie recenzioni ma non riesco a capire i voti come i 100 e gli 0,Personalmente rintengo il gioco scadente ma divertente per questo il mio voto è tra il 4 ed il 5. Preferisco dargli 4/10 per il frame rate e per i bug."

  ",4,"As a pokémon fan since the GBA era, I continue to get disappointed by the newer releases, but this seems especially bad on the Switch.
I'll admit, I enjoyed playing this game at first. The open world felt fresh and full of potential when I started, but the first problems arose when I entered the first big ""city"". A city where there are no houses to enter, only a handful of shops to ""enter"" and a school you can actually walk around in. This may seem like a minor thing, but it makes the world feel so much less interesting. Moving on, the story is actually pretty decent, even the rival is actually done well. Up to the league, the gameplay experience doesn't
change much which is fine, it's still pokémon, but then we enter the ""endgame"".

I say endgame, but in this game that basically means collecting a bunch of stuff and catching a couple of legendary pokémon, or breeding/training competitive pokémon. For anyone who has experienced the battle frontier, the pokémon world tournament or even the battle tower, this is by far the worst endgame out of all in this series.
Now it seems that the upcoming DLC will give us the actual endgame content, which I don't mind too much, IF it came out this year. However, so far it seems that the 2nd DLC will contain some sort of tournament/battle tower feature, but it is planned for somewhere in 2024...

Now the worst part, something I did not expect from a pokémon/Nintendo game, or at least not this bad: The bugs and the frame rate issues. These are unacceptable. For Nintendo to release such a big exclusive title in this state of performance is very disappointing. Even after various updates it's still bad.

Some other minor points:
- The pokémons spawns in the open world, especially for smaller creatures, is extremely annoying when you're going fast on your mount. You randomly run into them because they sometimes don't spawn on time
- Still no national dex
- Mega evolution still gone. Instead we get a weird looking alternative
- Weak outfit customization. Sure, they use the excuse that the school uniform is mandatory, but it still feels lazy
- The world has a lack of NPC's outside of cities, which makes it feel empty

I can only hope. once again, that they learn from this."

  ",9,"These, alongside Legends Arceus, are the best Pokemon games in the series. The Pokemon company have finally found their Breath of the Wild formula, and it is absolutely wonderful to play. As someone who has grown up on the likes of Playstation 1 and Nintendo 64, the ""lag"" and ""bad graphics"" don't affect my gameplay in the slightest, so this review is purely based on gameplay.

Never before have I said ""Wow!"" on route 1. It was usually just a couple of patches of grass and that was it. But not in this game. From the beginning to the end, I was left amazed of how beautiful the landscape was structured. Optional trainer battles were the step in the right direction as well. And the Pokemon are everywhere! It is not just a couple Pokemon here and there, and the variety is perfect as well. They are flying high in the skies, lurking deep in the seas and lakes, sleeping, eating, running in the fields... It really fells alive!

The next part is the story, and what a step up from previous series it is. There are 18 badges! One for each type. Personally, I enjoyed the Team Star badges the most, as the Starmobiles turned out to be quite the challenge at times, but the gyms and titan battles were amazing as well. Three different stories in one game, that beautifully merge into an ending I would never have expected from a Pokemon game. Getting the mascot Legendary at the start of the game and bonding with it throughout the story was an excellent choice. Koraidon has now earned the spot of one of my favorite legendaries.

This game truly is a dream come true for old school Pokemon fans, and I could say a million good things about these games, but apart from the technical difficulties (which I am not discussing in this review because everyone is talking about it already), there are a couple of things I would still like the games to improve on. The first one being text boxes. When you are in a battle, and the sandstorm is active, and both parties are using items such as leftovers, and you are poisoned, and so on... The game will stop, put up a textbox, stop, run the animation, stop, textbox.... Its just to much! All of this should just be performed in a single action. When the Stone Titans ability activated, every single boost had it's own animation and it's own textbox... Just run the animation one time and a textbox that says ""All stats have been raised"" and that's it. Battles take way too long, and for a company that removed the battle frontier because ""Kids these days don't have a long attention span"" this should be a priority. And the other thing would be difficulty. It's is great that it's an open world game and that you can go at your own pace, but there should still be a ""master mode"" just like in other open world games, to make replaying the games more fun.

This is it, this is the future of Pokemon, open fields with living Pokemon roaming them. If you truly cannot enjoy these games because of its technical difficulties, I totally understand, and I hope you keep on annoying Game Freak about it until they listen, because I really want all Pokemon fans to enjoy these games.

This and Legends Arceus have really been a dream come true and I can't wait to see what the Pokemon company has in store next."

  ",10,"The best modern Pokémon game, and the standard by which causal open world games will be judged.

One of the strongest assortment of new Pokémon, Garganacl and Lokix are some of my new favorites. The story and characters were actually really well written and after the joke that was Leon we actually have a competent and believable champion who commands respect. The ability to fight an gym in any order actually means that for the first time in over 15 years the game has some actually challenging moments. (Level scaling would run this TPCi please don’t add it)

Honestly the only negatives are the auto trainer battles are so mindless they might as well not exist, and so many Pokémon new and old feel so power crept it’s almost comical. E.g. why are both convergent species worse than their labor original? Why was Tinkaton given almost no attack and one of the worst signature moves ever? Why is Iron Jugulis weaker than Hydreigon?

The fact that Terastallizstion is the only battle gimmick to be agreed upon to be good, is really impressive, and it truly is a lot of fun to use even if staying the same type is the right call 90% of the time."

  ",6,"Boy this is going to be a tough one to review for me. I love Pokémon. Since I was a kid I've cared about the anime, the games, and the TCG for so long. So it hurts to say, other than the main story, this game is just so boring, I've been shiny hunting a ton because I'm a completionist and love the satisfaction from getting a shiny that I want. But the game is just really boring after you complete the surprisingly great main story.

Let me talk about the main story real quick because it might just be the greatest in the entire franchise. I love the ability to play 3 storylines and complete them all for them all to come full circle and have a great ending. This is the only Pokemon game that has ever made me come close to crying at how sad some parts were. I don't want to spoil much because it's so fun discovering things for yourself.

Now gameplay. This game is a buggy mess. Shi**y frame rates, terrible lighting, and just some awful bugs. I've seen some bugs where people's characters will just start having their head spin, or having their legendary become gigantic or just straight up disappear. It's inexcusable bugs that should never have made it past production. But if you can put those aside, it's just a Pokémon Game.

Even though I didn't really like Legends Arceus all that much due to my own person opinions on the game, it was still an innovation in the Pokémon franchise. But even though many people LOVED this game, they barely took anything from it and decided to make the game completely different. Like, let me throw my pokeballs in the overworld, let me walk around during battles, let me hear OVERWORLD SHINIES SPAWNING!

Also there's no voice acting still. Game Freak had Ed Sheeran money but not voice actor money..."

Graphically the agony of the white lines in the connections of the elements, like roof and house. In rank, from the Switch generation, it is the second worst game in the franchise, just ahead of the horrible remake of the fourth generation. It may be working now, but the franchise has to make a huge change in the games that justifies the absence of all the little creatures, since the game no longer presents the possibility of playing with all the creatures, as it was until the 3DS generations. Overall, 2 out of 10. It's almost throwing (a lot) money away."

The real problem of this game is not the performance, but the way the open world works.

Although you can visit the gyms and other stuff in the order you want, their level is fixed, so if you go the ""wrong"" other your experience will be either very frustrating for facing level 40 pokemon with level 25 ones and having to spend hours grinding, or way to easy for facing level 20 pokemon with level 40 ones.

I had a better experience after I looked the gym levels on the internet and followed that order, but that just breaks the whole open world idea, very disappointing.

Besides taht, overall I didn't like the new generation pokemon very much, some of then are copy of old pokemon with type differences and some are just weird, there is a rosck one whith such a poor design I though it was some king of bug until I entered battle with it.

There are some positive sides, I though the main story was the best in all the switch pokemons and now you can put your pokemon to battle alone and earn xp by himself which was a very nice addiction.

I do not recommend you to buy this game at whole price, it is a ok experience worth something, but not the full price."

  ",0,"You would be doing the Pokémon community a favor by avoiding Scarlet/Violet and Sword/Shield. We've proven that Pokémon is profiting more off releasing extremely unpolished, lackluster games deprived of heart, soul, originality, and content, than they do off releasing remotely finished games filled with lots of original ideas/creativity, exploration, fleshed out content, and at least decent performance. Don't expect the series to get much if any better from here for as long as people keep defending them. I'll even go as far as to say that 3.3 is too high of a score for these games.

I genuinely feel bad to be a Pokémon fan in this era. These games are a complete joke. At this point, the only good thing about modern day Pokémon is that old generations exist, and I say this in full belief that the 3DS games are no longer modern. This is about Gens 8-9.

Scarlet and Violet are the first Pokemon games in which I feel Pokémon's soul has completely died.

Pokémon went on its major downfall in overall reception starting with **Sword and Shield**. This is supported by google reviews, metacritic user reviews, and official critic reviews across the board. All of the first seven generations were made at least decently for their time. Some are great, some are okay but passable. They were all Pokémon games made well with the necessary (minimum+) content needed for their time, solid performance, solid visuals, and a solid amount of gameplay options. They all made a lot of great changes to the series in some aspects and left room for lots of interesting things to talk about. I personally think the DS era was overrated and no better than the 3DS era, since plenty  of the games contained a lot of flaws contributing to the stagnation of the series and decline of its popularity at the time, but really, almost all of Gens 1-7 in Pokemon was something to look up to, but this review isn't about that.

SwSh deprived the series very hard from what the 3DS games had to offer, which is a strong part why these games are very hated, we just don't realize it yet, but this was on top of the games having blatantly unfilled promises Gamefreak made and heavily rushed development time.

Scarlet and Violet are a complete joke for a Pokémon game for multiple reasons outside the obvious graphical issues, bugs, and issues with exploring the overworld with too many inaccessible buildings. They no longer even have a battle facility this time, it took them months to bring back the 60 minute battle timer, there is no set mode, option to turn off battle animations, or option to toggle off EXP Share. Scarlet and Violet failed to flesh themselves out at all and couldn't even get their main appeal right, which is the open world. There is no level scaling for this open world game. These Pokémon games now even lack basic lore for what makes their mascots legendary this time. That's a first! We have to pay an extra 35 bucks to possibly find that out. In addition, the marketing for Scarlet and Violet was incredibly scandalous. Gamefreak tryharded for these games to receive as much attention as possible by giving us well-presented trailers, one of which even had voice acting, hiding the errors of their game beforehand, and they even designed a truckton of characters and Pokémon to follow some kind of trend, trope, or other familiar face recognized in media. Turo is literally gigachad, we got a Pokémon named ""LeChonk"", we got a Minecraft golem thing, Meowscarda is literally everything Pokémon fans asked the cat starter not to be, the legendaries are just unimaginative amalgamations of everything that seemed cool about previous box arts, shoved together into two creatures, we got a vtuber, we got NPCs who resemble actual youtubers, we have the most unimaginative mechanic ever, but an idea that was obviously going to be the hopes and dreams of your average Pokémon fan.

I could list more examples, including how elements of the story include a fight against bullying and saving a dog from dying, more relatable situations than what Pokemon was meant to be for, but I'll just say Pokémon knew what they were doing. Gamefreak is relying on a bunch of tropes, social trends, 'wokeness', popularized faces in media, engineering the new Pokémon, characters, and trailers to look as visually appealing as they could possibly be, while even going as far as to add signs of misleading elements to the trailers like voice acting and lack of explored gameplay for the sake of creating more appeal. Doesn't matter if anything they do lacks substance, lack meaning, is sacrificing any form of structure the series have provided that had to be made for the sake of gameplay.  It's now ""haha this looks cool so it's good"". They made everything look as glamorous as possible in order to excuse releasing a pile of garbage. An overwhelming amount of people have pre-ordered SV off this. In other words, we have been hardcore baited and are still accepting these games!"

Despite the reported performance issues and glitches ( which, in my case, weren't game breaking at all, but mild inconveniences ), it's the first true non-linear, open world Pokémon game. The tera gimmick, although a downgrade from megas, is an upgrade from Z-moves and Gigamax, allowing for more competitive strategic opportunities. The pokemon designs work and experiment with new ideas ( palafin, tatsugiri-dondozo to name a few ), plus the Paradox designs bring new life to beloved mons from past generations. The weekly raid events help to keep the players engaged.
The only downside are the performance issues, which makes it hard to justify the full price tag, but i don't think the game should be downgraded for it, and instead it should be judged by what it is: a well-executed modernization of the beloved, tried and true Pokémon format."

Aunque no todo su contenido es criticable, sí que es cierto que da la impresión de que el juego no está bien adaptado para jugarlo en la Switch, y se siente como si se hubiera hecho con prisa.
A diferencia del Leyendas de Arceus, esta nueva generación se siente más viva gracias a su historia, cinemáticas, y animaciones, pero la experiencia se interrumpe por la bajísima calidad del renderizado y de los framerate.

Es complicado sentirse cómodo al moverse por el mundo de Paldea cuando cada poco rato sientes que el juego sufre para no colapsarse tratando de reducir su rendimiento y calidad (aun teniendo en cuenta que la capacidad de la Switch es de 40fps y 720p). Y es triste que pase este tipo de problemas teniendo en cuenta que el mundo de Paldea no está tan detallado como otros juegos de la compañía."

If you want an RPG with love and effort put into it, play Earthbound, Mother 3, Paper Mario, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door, Super Mario RPG, Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2, Chrono Trigger, Golden Sun, Persona 3, Persona 4, Persona 5, Fallout New Vegas, Deus Ex, Mass Effect 2, Secret of Mana, and a ton more I'm forgetting. And if you desperately need to experience a Pokemon game, play Pokemon Black & White and Pokemon Black 2 & White 2, they provide entertaining gameplay and the best story in the series, and of course they actually are quality games unlike the pile of garbage called Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. The game is so bad, there's no point in even reviewing the actual gameplay, but I'll do a brief rundown anyway. It's much like the previous games, Pokemon Sword & Shield, but worse. The graphics make me want to stop playing the game, nearly every GameCube game looks better than this. And before anyone thinks ""It's on the Switch they're limited by the hardware waaaah"" look at other Switch games, like Super Mario Odyssey or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, nearly every minute detail in those games looks good, despite the hardware being inferior to the competitors. Now the gameplay, if I had to describe it with one word, would be ""mindless"". Getting experience was already easy with the overpowered exp share item that's unable to be turned off, but now with the auto battle mechanic, there's no need to even play the game to level up, just auto battle and sit back and relax. The trainers are hilariously weak, and they don't even battle you when they see you like the previous games, you have to walk up and talk to them to battle them. However. despite all my hate for these games I must admit if they had another year, Hell, a few more months of development time, they would've been much better. The quality of the series has been dipping more and more ever since they started with annual releases, and I can't blame them for doing this. Pokemon fans will buy and defend any pile of **** that their lord GameFreak puts out, so no matter how horrid the games are, they'll sell well, and it will continue until the fans actually use their brain. In conclusion, don't buy this game, it blows."

The ""Open World"" is boring and effing stupid. No discernible landmarks aside ""lag lake"", no care and a crappy draw distance to boot really make me hate walking through the game. And this being the game that depends the most out of any other Pokemon-Game to have ""enjoyable"" movement.... nope, not this.
The only good thing about this game is that there is a really good story in S/V. One of the 3 best stories in Pokemon and that is the only reason I don't wanna give this game a 0. Or would have stated ""would give minus score if possible"".

I believe that the tera itself is a mechanic that needs to be forgotten quickly so that pokemon goes back to what it was. Tera raid also has several problems with bugs and a real obligation to make the pokemon X mode so that you can win the tera raid, which leads us to the question... After all, the game is for fun or to play for a fixed mode to be able to win a super augmented fight that doesn't reflect the tera raid pokemon?!

Thought I'd at least enjoy the meta but it requires so much grinding of tera raids which a lot of time include stall and **** mechanics which aren't fun when you do 20+ a day so maybe you can get the battle item you need to actually level the playing field competitively. This was an unenjoyable mess. There is nothing I would consider fun about this game in post. It had the same feel at first of enjoying a new world and learning about the new pokemon and characters. But its quickly dashed by the ""everything else"" about the game.
Graphics are so bad they pull you out of the game half the time. Like I get what they were TRYING to do but the execution was just so awful.
A lot of the mechanics aren't old favorites or new and exciting, the Terastal phenomenon is so underwhelming that half the time I don't use it because of the massive downsides that come with locking your pokemon to a single type for a mid damage increase is often not even worth the extra few seconds of animation.
Also tying THE legendary pokemon to your bicycle seems fun but uh, its super **** annoying when you try to use it as a pokemon because you are so conditioned to ride it and when you do it stops being  a battle pokemon. I gave up on ev training it and spent the fortune on vitamins cause I couldn't train them otherwise.
Over all even if I ignored the performance issues the game is a chore and everything feels half assed.
Also, quit expecting everyone to have multiple friends handy. The 5 and 6 star raids have the items I need but are unbeatable without either getting INCREDIBLY lucky with randoms or the perfect stack of npcs

My first Pokemon game was yellow, I've been in this for a long time and too see what I thought was the most stable franchise kow tow to investors to push out an unfinished game even months later was just so much of a disappointment I have no hope for the future of the Pokemon gaming franchise and game-freak itself"

  ",7,"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet push the franchise forward, while also holding the franchise back.

The most glaring flaw in Scarlet and Violet is evident right at the start, the performance issues are a major problem and actively distract fr0m the game experience.  With good performance as rare as frame-drops are in many other first party Nintendo titles, it's a near constant fight to ignore the issues to attempt to enjoy what else there is to like here.  With pop-in, level of detail, texturing issues and flickering characters, Pokemon spawning inside of walls and camera clipping, there is rarely an instance where you won't be finding issues.  Compare this to GameFreaks previous entry Legends Arceus, and you have to wonder how it all went so horribly wrong as many of the issues experienced here are non-existent there.  While performance will affect many others differently, it affected my overall enjoyment greatly, and is inconsistent with what the previous entries led me to expect.

The Open World is a great addition to the series, with the ability to choose your own path within reason, and choose whether or not you want to fight your way through higher leveled areas right away and have your own challenge, or start lower and work your way up.  I often found myself getting lost within the world and continually catching new Pokemon and finding ways to battle Pokemon sometimes nearly twice my own level.  While sometimes areas feel a little barren, for the most part I think the areas were pleasant to visit and enjoy.  Proper Pokemon scaling is a welcome addition, although sometimes a nuisance for smaller Pokemon as the lock-on feature is again, not as polished as the previous entry, and while Let's Go is a great way to battle, collect materials, shiny hunt and have Pokemon follow you, the distance at which your Pokemon will disappear fr0m you and some speed issues make it feel less like a companion feature, and more like a utility to be used sparingly.  Picnics are a fun idea, although also marred with technical issues that are noticeable enough, I often view this as a utility for shiny hunting or breeding alone.

While I enjoy riding the title Pokemon and developing its powers, the encounter system feels half-baked compared to Legends Arceus.  Throwing Pokeballs fr0m a distance and accompanying repositioning of your trainer to fit into a proper battle area feels clunky, and while the battles themselves maintain a competitive based formula, they also feel lacking.  Contact animations are noticeably absent for many moves where they existed within Legends, and the battle system camera, while rotatable, results in some odd visual issues at times that would have been better solved with either a moveable trainer, or a completely dynamic fixed camera similar to what already existed within gym battles.  Multiplayer ends up being an enjoyable feature, exploring the world around your friends and seeing their progress is great, and being able to breed Pokemon with your friends without the need to trade is a neat addition.

The story is one of the better within the Pokemon Series and benefits with an air of mystery around certain aspects that reminded more of how Souls games might approach the history and lore of the region rather than your typical Pokemon game.  This is definitely a highlight of the game, and something that actively kept me going despite performance issues.  As of the current update, much of the story aspects are left unexplained, and so we can only theorize as to what is to come in future updates (hopefully alongside performance improvements).

The characters within the game itself are also very enjoyable, each Gym Leader, main character and teacher within the world with their own personality and interactions within their respective sphere that made it much more enjoyable to visit with characters than some of the recent entries.

Despite all my gripes with the game and how it would have benefited greatly fr0m extra time in development, the good aspects of the game remain one of the more memorable entries in my mind.  If GameFreak can patch up the performance and many of the bugs, I think the entry could be one of the finest the series has to offer.  However, at the moment, it fights against itself and becomes an entry that was marred by the franchises own dependence on a fixed release schedule.  I can only hope that GameFreak allows themselves more time for future entries, as well as invests heavily in better technical prowess.  As the evolution of gameplay continues, the technology needs to do the same to continue pushing the series to new heights, instead of holding it back."

This may also possibly be the best story in any main-line Pokemon game to date; being able to take on three different paths with compelling characters and interactions makes me glad to read the dialogue for once. The only two things I can see holding this game back are it's performance/bugs and it's controls, which are big downsides to the game, but it is possible to look past them.

""You'll be able to experience the true joy of the Pokémon seriesbattling against wild Pokémon in order to catch themnow in an open-world game that players of any age can enjoy."" True joy? You say? Well, how are people supposed to enjoy true joy with these ""Games"" when things such as constant bugs, glitches, and frame rate drops ruin the overall experience while traveling from one zone to the next on your ""Legendary Pokemon?"" All of this is the fault of the poorly thought-out and lag-filled Paldea region. One moment you'll be adventuring through the region at a stable 30 FPS, and then the next moment 15 FPS or lower.

The only other game I've seen do that is True Crime: New York on PS2, a game released during the sixth generation of consoles back in late 2005, almost 20 years before the launch of the Gen 9 titles. And yet Pokemon Scarlet and Violet seem to run even worse than TC:NY on a console almost three times as powerful as the PS2. It is evident from how the last main entry went (Pokemon Sword and Sheild) the next games wouldn't fare much better, but to the absolute shock of everyone, Pokemon Scarlet is not only worse than Sword and Sheild but also the single-handedly worse Pokemon title ever made—a travesty on all fronts. Released from a triple-A studio, and we get a 60-dollar game that plays and performs like an early-access Steam game at best and a PS2 Tech Demo at worst. It's obvious that Game Freak rushed this game to launch, for one reason or another. I'm both shocked and appalled that nobody at the company stood up and asked for more development time, who knows? Maybe an additional year or so of development would've made this into a decent or better title. But no, we instead get sacked with an excuse of a video game that's one of gaming's biggest letdowns, if not the biggest letdown. Apart from offering refunds for this mess of code, Game Freak's efforts are downright appalling. Imagine this, say a patch comes out for a game that you've been waiting for weeks since its launch, only for said patch to delete your save file in which you've spent hours on, that's what happened to Scarlet and Violet. Even with the positives, such as its story and somewhat ""interesting"" replacement for mega evolutions in the form of Terastallizing, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will go down in history as not only Pokemon's worst game, but also Nintendo's worst game as well."

The game is a buggy mess and the performance is terrible and that has barely changed since launch, the game was not polished enough prior to release and was rushed out, as we know from datamining, they had work done on interiors before scrapping it, unlike previous pokemon entries you could enter houses and talk to people inside they cut back considerably on that, in fact you cannot enter the vast majority of houses.

There is no scaling in this game which leads to trainers, gym leaders and pokemon in general being severely underlevelled if you decide to explore and catch some pokemon this leads to the game becoming extremely easy, you could argue that all pokemon games are easy but scarlet and violet take the cake on this one. The game would of been much better if some form of level scaling existed to keep pokemon, trainers and gym leaders at your level instead of punishing you for exploring, let me also remind you, this is open world and you're punished for exploring (well done Game freak).

The recent patch introduced a new bug which can wipe your save data, currently they don't know the cause and say it will be fixed when they do however the next bug fix patch is due before the "" end of april "" many issues that were present at launch are still around and kicking and game freak simply does not release bug fix patches frequently enough.

If I was to sum up the negatives into a TL:DR it would be this

- Interiors are gone
- There is no scaling
- Gym leaders don't fight you in gyms (might sound a but whiny, I know)
- Koridon's "" flight "" is worse than Braviary's in Arceus
- A plethora of bugs and performance problems, still persisting.
- Customisation isn't as great due to the forced school uniform
- No Clefairy (God damn GF why?! - Nitpicky, I know)

If I was to give positives

- Open World
- A story that is more than just "" defeat the elite four + champion ""
- The TM crafting machine
- Better Picnic
- Sprigatito

On the whole the game could of been so much more, it's not a 0 and it's not a 10, beware those type of reviews. In future if level scaling was added and gym leaders were actually gym leaders not fight you in a nearby park guys and more polishing before release they could have an absolute unit ****."

How a game from the largest franchise in the world can be released in such a state is beyond baffling. It could possibly be excused if the game was gorgeous, but it's biblically ugly!

However, I haven't enjoyed a Pokemon game this much since Heart Gold/Soul Silver! The story is vastly improved on previous entries and I haven't been this motivated to ""Catch them all"" in a long long time. The gameplay loop is absolutely captivating.

The fact that this game came out and actually stopped me from playing God of War Ragnorok is insane, and that is not to imply for one second that this is a better game, but there is something completely enchanting about it.

I wish, this could be a warning to the Pokemon company, that they can't keep releasing games like this, but the truth of the matter is, they have no reason to try any harder. The games will always sell well.

But if, IF they could take the time and effort to release a Pokemon game that took the timeless gameplay and merged it with a gorgeous functioning world, it could be one of the best games ever made.

Instead we have Scarlet and Violet, a very confusing generation of vastly contrasting qualities."

But after finishing the game, I felt like I’d been robbed for buying it. S/V looks and runs like a bad PS2 game, legitimately makes Arceus look like Elden Ring when you compare screenshots. I bought the game because I thought I could overlook this, but it’s impossible to miss because your CHARACTER’S SPEED is tied to the frame rate…which constantly dips between 10-15 FPS. So you really feel when the game is chugging along. Graphics aren’t everything, but they’re far more important to create a compelling open world to explore.

Of course, the game has its issues and controversies. First off, THE LAG. DEAR LORD, THE LAG. There is a LOT of lag in the games, some versions are worse off than others when it comes to lag, however it's unfortunate how many of the places are hard to traverse due to how the game chugs in areas with a lot of Pokémon.

Second off, just like Sword and Shield, not every Pokémon is accessible. Sure, it's not the worst thing, especially to those who don't really care about using Pokémon from older games, but it's a shame to those who are attached to an old mon of theirs, and how some people get a bit upset if their favorite isn't in the game (mine isn't in SV yet, upsettingly, but hopefully it'll return in the DLC)

I grew up with the Pokémon series, ever since I first played Omega Ruby on my 3DS. This game is great, but it's another showcase on why the games need to be worked on a bit more before they release; a year of development isn't enough time anymore."

Empty world, awful cities, cute Pokémon aesthetics but nothing exceptional. This is a game full of flaws, the only thing it really succeeded in are the characters, which I genuinely liked (Clavell, Arven, Larry, Penny and Team Stars).
For them alone, I don't feel like putting less than 4."

  ",2,"Most games deal in either/or. Either you can have great graphics, or you can have a huge world. Either you can have full voice acting, or you can have lots of dialogue, or a compromise with some Voice acting. On the other hand, modern Pokémon is: Neither.

You have a technically broken game. The first truly open map is nice, but its still basic, lacking interesting exploration or atmosphere. Visually this looks like ****, a free online game. You have couple of flat textures copy pasted on surfaces as if by an amateur. When you walk into major cities, like the the electric gym, it's like you are looking at the concept notes of a place. It would be cool, if it was actually finished. As it is, the flat textures look ugly everywhere, there are hardly any interiors and barely any foot traffic. Whatever NPCs that walk around look like broken automatons because of the framerate. How do you immerse the player in a bustling, high tech city setting when the visual details, frame rate utterly fail to create that atmosphere? The only thing that comes through and works well is the music. Compare this to other games, like the hubs in Splatoon that also try to convey a busting urban area - It's embarrassing by comparison. They even took away the extensive wardrobe customization

In order to offer meager modernization in the form of 3d, open worlds, Pokemon has regressed beyond belief in almost every other regard. The flow in Legends Arceus, where battles were seamless and  wouldn't chug along with each notification ""X was paralysed!"" Stopping everything one by one is abandoned, and again now Pokemon is excruciatingly slow, slower than before because of the performance. How do you offer such a technically basic world, lacking features, and also have it look this bad and ALSO not even run well?

I understand Gamefreak and Pokemon Company can make a lot of money regardless. The brand is strong. But for how long? And why are they comfortable with disrespecting their own brand so much? Pikachu is like Japan's mickey mouse. The highest grossing entertainment franchise, Pokemon is like a cultural institution and a form of soft power for Japan. Following on with the Disney comparison, which is globally deeply associated with American culture, you would never see a major Disney film with poor production. They might not be good films always, often formulaic. But across the animated work, star wars and marvel, the production will be professional and high quality. It goes to show how empty and nihilistic corporate Japan is, that they do not treat their own cultural treasure of Pokémon with the same grace. Eventually the brand will be weakened by this.

The good: The open world structure is nice, the narrative is more fun than most previous entries too.  They have refreshed how professors, legendries and more fit into the Pokemon world. It's far behind other games still - Even games aimed at all ages - But there is some more thoughtful worldbuilding than previous entries. The formula works well with an open world and the 3 non-linear mission paths. It would not be hard to make this game fun and acceptable, and it would not be especially expensive or time consuming. But the technical issues and sheer sloppiness are just so distracting, it continually impedes any immersion for me. Like I said, every area feels like concept notes, not even a Beta state of the game. It literally feels like a free online game, but its full retail instead.  Every step forward in terms of modernization seems to be a new low for GameFreak and Pokemon."

  ",6,"I'm writing this from the review of someone who has been playing the games since pearl, & been a fan since the very beginning thanks to the anime. I have played almost every generation of pokemon, retroactively or remade & experienced a large number of the changes that the franchise has gone through. The graphics changing over time, as well as the main gameplay loop shifting when new mechanics are added & removed. With gen 9, this will be my 6th pokemon game to experience around it's release.

Pokemon Scarlet, the version I got specifically, was definitely a game. To help break it down, mimicking the 3 story paths of this game, I too will give 3 scores to reach my final answer.

First off, the story, one the main draws of any game, regardless of genre. It blew me away, plain and simple. Of course there were twists here and there, who someone actually was, what their plan was this whole time & what they were planning to do.

Path of legends was the first one for me to do and, for most of it, I already knew what was coming, as many, many people spoiled it before I had my own chance to play it. Regardless of knowing it beforehand, the parts in between that I hadn't seen myself, as well as the ending were new to me, & worked effectively. I truly believe this one needed a blind play through, much like star street, to be enjoyed to the fullest.

Speaking of star street, I knew who certain folks were, as it was somewhat obvious. What did get to me though, was the entire story behind and around team star. There was no sign beforehand that could have prepared me for the roller coaster & honestly relatable story of Team Star. Honestly, all the teams throughout the series have had some grand goal. Reset the universe in their own image, expand the land & sea, reach across dimensions to capture rare & exotic creatures to manipulate for their own needs. But this one? This team? Actually hit me. It's one that, as an adult, I understood, & know that a lot of kids will actually be able to care about for once. One that, anyone really, should on some level be able to insert themselves into. That is if they're not a youtuber who skips all the dialogue and only notices one line mentioning one of the bosses being a rich kid.

Victory Road was. Well it was the standard fanfare of every game in the series. 8 gyms, to then face the elite four and champ with a rival to face every few gyms or so. Well, with the twist of being able to face them in any order there is no right way to go after them. However, the gyms levels & teams are already set. They don't adjust based on how many badges you already have, even with taking into account victory road badges alone. I'd be lying if I wasn't disappointed, as I had hoped we would finally see a true difficulty scaling that the other games never had. Gym leaders, and elite four(which fall into the same trap) aside, there's your rival, Nemona. She's probably the best in a long time. While people have been craving those edgy & snide rivals, Nemona continues the trend of a supportive and positive one, but in a way that's. Actually fun? She's battle obsessed, self aware & genuine. She even sees losing to you as the best thing because you're actually a challenge and, let me tell you, she gets challenging later on.

Now, when all 3 paths are done, there's of course after game. Yeah can't say what happens there without spoiling but it. It was intense. There were twists I didn't imagine and honestly, this made Sc/Vi the best written mainline game in a good long while.

The story collectively was 8/10 for me. There were issues here and there, but honestly it was. Wonderfully well written.

Now, the graphics. GOD THE GRAPHICS. I'm gonna use Sw/Sh and Arceus as a comparison. Sc/Vi tries to ditch the cartoony lines the other 2 had & it's to it's own detriment. Pokemon look wonderful, but the human characters, including a few of the main cast, kinda. Look bland? It really feels flat there. The quality almost felt like what I would expect from Su/Mo, 3DS games. There was a lot of low quality textures blown up, including logos for banners the size of your character, then 5 minutes later the same texture but vectored? So it was very. Inconsistent. This isn't including bugs, which can be patched out, I can't say the same for the shadow and textures though. There's horrendous pop in, genuinely feet in front of your character, and frame drops from looking at a wall vs the vast ocean.

Overall? 3/10. If it were patched out, then I would change that.

Now comes the pokemon. Save for a few. That were just very basic, like a lawn flamingo, they felt the most fun they've ever been. Except for Skeledirge. That's just a red crocodile... Without revealing any designs, they felt genuinely fun and creative.

9/10

The game felt rushed. It had 3 years, where BoTW, another open world game, had 6. I genuinely believe if they had more time, they could do amazing things, & this hints at that.

6.5/10"

  ",6,"overall this game is fun and what feels like a quarter baked attempt by The Pokemon Company. The game itself looks good, until you start to look at the things in the background that are supposed to make the game feel more alive and you notice the slideshow style flapping of Starraptor wings, or other trainers/pokemon moving at 3-5 frames per second. The story backtracks on itself at the last possible moment because TPC decided to stop making a good point. While some features in the game help to make it feel better, such as being able to change your move set anywhere in the world or allowing your monsters to run free and make grinding less annoying. taking away the ability to drop eggs off on a daycare and the godawful online experience that is raid battling help to make this a more taxing entry in the series. I did enjoy two of the three main story lines, and I liked the direction that some of the gameplay features took but at the end of the day this was a more dissapointing entry and I hope that TPC takes the time they need to work on a game instead of going to a once a year release cycle."

  ",5,"I played Pokemon Red when I was six years old. It was decently challenging but completely within my ability to play and beat. If a six year old could beat the original games, there is really no need to make the new ones easier, especially SO much easier. You can swap out Pokemon between your party and the boxes at any time, so there's no challenge in traversing a large distance between Pokemon centers without your whole party fainting. Most trainers only have one Pokemon and are often a one hit KO. You can fly right off the bat so you're never at risk of your party fainting outside of a few moderately tough boss fights. The have is still fun and I'm enjoying it, but there's zero challenge in it anymore and it's frustrating because there are probably as many adults who play Pokemon as there are children, and the original games were still more than accessible enough for children. There was no need to strip out any degree of challenge. Also Team Star aren't even bad guys. The whole thing is just Pokemon in ultra baby mode."

Its open world is an interesting mechanics, but it is empty, laggy, ugly, and useless.
The controls are ridiculous; who in the hell thought summoning your mount had to be on the PAUSE button? and the menus are a headache to navigate, but they look cool. The three-part story is also pretty fine in itself, it's just getting through that is bad. The new Pokémon, mounts included, look good despite the graphics. But the rest is ugly, waving in the ground, performs like hell. There is waaaaay less content than Breath of the Wild, and it runs worse.

One of the worst Pokémon games for sure, and it might be where I decide to buy them only when a properly made Pokémon with care and more than a year will release. Until then, not a dime on Pokémon anymore."

  ",1,"In the Olive themed gym, you push around a giant olive, and there's a section where you fight a gym trainer to unlock a shortcut. The shortcut is obviously longer and slower than the regular path. In that same gym, the floor collision is accidentally placed too high, so all characters awkwardly levitate 2 inches off the ground. The game is filled with moments like these, where the devs put zero effort or thought into anything. It's such a poorly designed game from all aspects that I want to believe this game is a parody and everyone claiming to like the game are in on a joke like the Morbius fan base.

Critics may hyper-focus on the bugs and graphics, which are valid critiques, but it distracts from this game lacking quality and care in ALL aspects. For example, the new ""auto battling"" feature lets you essentially skip trainer battles entirely, it's an embarrassingly broken progression system. Adding a meat ingredient sandwich in a game world that has no animals is an example of terrible world building, it seems the devs forget that adding food with meat in it implies that Pokemon are slaughtered and eaten by people. And are we going to ignore how uncreative ""making sandwiches"" is as a signature mechanic? Especially because the last game had a big focus on ""making curry"".

This is an unquestionably a product of laziness. And if you are capable of lowering your standards to enjoy a game as poorly made as this one, the question remains why you don't play a cheaper alternative? If you have standards low enough to enjoy this game you shouldn't be shelling out 60+$ for any game."

Not really minus a few instances such as raid dens and specific areas in the game which is kind of a let down because graphically this game makes no sense. Sometimes the graphics of the mountains are super detailed and sometimes they’ll remind you of the old ps2 days I grew up with. Glitch wise they are buggy now and then and will have some really annoying glitches happening but never something that will delete save file or do anything drastic, mostly the downsides of this game is the performance aspect in terms of frame drops which if you are truly a fan of pokemon you will very likely overlook as I did. Scarlet and Violet absolutely have that same magic that was captured in Legends Arceus which was an absolute breath of fresh air. While scarlet and violet did take a step back one thing I had noticed is that I had this really big itch to catch all the pokemon which is typically present in the mainline games but something felt different, It felt as if i had to catch everything and in a few days i went from 50 pokemon and the beginning of the game to 380+ pokemon and doing 7 star online special raids and I can’t exactly tell you why and what happened but there was a big feeling of needing to have everything in this game much more than I had ever felt in a pokemon game and maybe it’s down to how I tend to love open world games such as Zelda and Elden Ring, but something about seeing something that I could lock onto and find out if i had caught or not compelled me to catch everything in sight. Would 100000% reccomend to a true pokemon fan who loves the series. Anyways thanks for reading"

O jogo parece frágil, que a qualquer momento vai dar crash, mal polido, texturas porcas, objetos que ficam piscando na tela, iluminação que aparece e desaparece, o chão do jogo ao olhar de perto é cortado e aparece tudo que está em baixo etc. È uma pena, pois esse jogo evoluindo do jeito que merecia , sendo até com esses gráficos mesmo, mas bem feito, bem otimizado e atualizado, seria com certeza o jogo ano em todos os anos. Um fato que me incomoda é que até hoje o jogo não tem falas, não tem reações naturais e não é localizado para outras línguas. Vão acabar perdendo os fãs de Pokémon, o que pode ser bom, pois ai troca de desenvolvedora, podendo ir para uma que realmente sabe fazer jogos de verdade.

The Pokémon franchise had everything to be the best game franchise of all time, but unfortunately the developer accommodated in the success that the game already has and launch them completely poorly. The game seems fragile, that at any moment it will crash, poorly polished, dirty textures, objects that keep blinking on the screen, lighting that appears and disappears, the game floor when looking closely is cut and everything below appears etc. . It's a shame, because this game evolving the way it deserved, even with these graphics, but well done, well optimized and updated, would certainly be the game of the year in all years. One fact that bothers me is that even today the game has no lines, no natural reactions and is not localized into other languages. They'll end up losing Pokémon fans, which could be a good thing, as they change developers and go to one that really knows how to make real games."

anyways, the game is AWESOME!!! lovely story, great graphics, cool new pokes, and big plot twists. presents a challenge for those who rush in too quickly, and rewards for being successful. the enemy team may look kind of dumb and weak, but trust me, dont underestimate their leaders. same goes with the gym leaders (although they dont look dumb) they can be a real pain if you have the wrong/low level pokemon. im not going to spoil anything else, but overall game was 10/10 and i highly recommend getting this. and once more, READ THE STATEMENT ABOVE THIS SECTION!!!"

The game has crashed several times and throughout the entirety of the time that I've owned a switch, no other game has crashed even once for me, none. Then there's the actual game, the story is boring. I quickly skimmed through most conversations, you know what's about to happen because every part of each quest is just a repeat of the previous part. The open world is barren, the cities/ towns are basically all the same. The only thing that differs is the biome. And the Pokemon, like seriously Flamigo? Lazy isn't a strong enough word. Honestly you could have slapped a second head on it or gave it a spiky butt, hell anything, they literally just put a flamingo in, removed the n from the name and that was it. Pokemon fans deserve better than rubbish. It's clearly unfinished and unoptimized. Either the devs were lazy and didn't care or more than likely were under pressure to release it by a certain date, finished or not."

The videogame performance is horrible, with a lot of fps drops, and it has some visual bugs that can be a bit annoying. Ignoring all this it is a great videogame for it's excellent soundtrack, characters, story and for being a very fun open world to play. The capture system is worse than the Pokémon Legends Arceus' but it isn't bad. The freedom you have is a fresh thing in the Pokémon games, but a bad aspect of this freedom is that the levels of the other pokémon don't go at your level, so you can fight a gym leader that has Pokémon level 20 with your Pokémon at level 40 if you have done a different gym order. A strong point of the game is the story, which is  deeper than the habitual Pokémon story.
In conclusion, Pokémon Scarlet is a recommended videogame for all Pokémon fans, but you have to know that it has some aspects to improve, specially the performance."

Since Nintendo still doesn't want to invest in server in facking 2023, the peer to peer is a facking nightmare.
the game just freeze for no reason and doesn't let you play.
Horrible when the battle has a TIMER.
Sometime you can skip 3 to 5 turn before being able to access the menu
Sometime the game just randomly add HP to the boss
On some raid we had to put the boss at 0 hp SEVEN time and it still won't facking die
every time his HP dropped to 0, the game freeze and just put it back at 10 to 15% HP like nothing happened, and we just lost to time
This is unacceptable for a game that sold 10 millions.
between this and the terrible graphic, bug and everything that needed at least a YEAR of development, GameFreak just blatantly spat on the fanbase.
with the EndGame litteraly unplayable, i don't recommend the purge that this game is at the moment.

Open word: a jumbled mess.
Difficulty curve: a **** saw.

It's like Nintendo sent down the directive to Gamefreak to make the next Pokemon game open world, but none of them had any clue what that actually meant. The game is a hot mess and a prime example that not everything HAS to be open world.

There is no direction in the open world, you are free to roam around anywhere. BUT. If you look at the levels of the trainers/gym leaders/titans, there is a very clear path they really wanted to take. Why then not just make a more traditional guided play though? Why have an open world at all? And why for all that is holy do they not have any indication that you are not where you're supposed to be until you get your teeth kicked in by enemies way higher in level than you?

Those are all cornerstone open world design elements that have been utterly bungled.

The performance of the switch is notoriously terrible, but this monstrosity takes the cake. Constant non-stop hitching, stuttering, and wildly variable frame rates plague every corner of this honestly quite ugly open world. It's so bad that it constantly takes you out of the game.

There are a few good things added this generation, but all the terrible failures make me no longer care.

This game was not built to run on a console as under-powered as the Switch, and it struggles constantly in both handheld and docked mode. Alongside the frame rate issues are a wealth of bugs that constantly either break the game or severely hinder progress.

Frankly it is an unplayable mess and one that I had to ask for a refund for.

Beyond the graphical issues and the horrendous performance, the game still doesn't feel as ambitious as it should be, and neither the storyline or the scope of the game stand up to other open world competitors in 2022.

In my opinion, its time Pokemon games were made for PC and other consoles if the series is to match what the fans want. This approach of constant compromise and minor updates feels like a way to capitalise and profit from an increasingly restless fanbase.

Unless you are a hardcore Pokemon fan, avoid this game - and, even then, I'd still give it a miss."

The only positives I can think of was there were alot of cool new Pokémon and the music was pretty good. Honestly I can not believe I am saying this, but I even enjoyed Sword/Shield more than this with the dlc. I honestly don't think updates/dlc can even fix the game. Its just so awful to play. I feel the life force of my switch draining whenever I play the game for more than an hour. Compared to other Pokémon games, even on the same system, it feels like a 5 dollar steam game in beta.

The open world thing is a lie since if you don't have all the Koraidon/Miraidon features you can't reach all places around the map, also the level design is very bad and embarrassing. There are giant empty fields where you can find random creatures groups putted there with no sense at all. Creatures don't interact with you nor with other pokémons, they just stand there and walk around. I don't want to talk about bugs and stuff like that cause everyone talked about it already before. The academy place is just a group of rooms in which you can follow like 3 interesting lessons and A LOT of useless dialogues about futile and trivial subjects. Also this is a clear declaration from The Pokémon Company to make fun of fans and buyers, they don't care about our fun, enjoyment, entertainment, they just think about their schedule and don't give a f*ck about people. I'm very disappointed (cause I can talk about these games problems like for a week) and I really hate to feel zero in front of the brand I love since I was a very young kid and in which I spent time and money.

This game was a lot of what I wanted pokemon games to be like and I'm happy with some of the decisions that were made, but I did still have a few gripes about certain characters, the lack of voice acting, and the performance of course.
Ultimately, I have loved nearly all of the major moments of my experiences with this generation, so much so that I might go back and get a copy of Violet as well.
I'm also doing a second playthrough in Japanese on my second profile. The dialogue is only a bit above my comprehension level, and they use Furigana, so it's easier to understand. Because I've only been studying for a few years and I'm still at a grade school level with the language. This game seems like a good game to try to play in Japanese, for what that's worth.

I am sad about the presence of these performance issues and some of the issues it had caused when I did certain activities such as shiny hunting, etc. So I've docked a few points for it, but ultimately the changes to the formula and the way the gameplay loop feels, It got me to actually enjoy the first pokemon game since Sun/Moon, or gen 1-3. I still hope they fix some things in the future with this game, but even if they don't, I'm still excited about where the series seems to be heading. Cautiously optimistic at least."

Issues are the performance lags that the Switch cannot handle. They happen more often the later into the game you get. The lag is very frustrating at times.

Also the world is not like Skyrim that mostly levels up with the player. You'll return to areas super over powered or severly underpowered. It would me nice if the world map at least showed the needed level for certain missions/gyms before traveling across the map for a place I can't play yet.

Last complaint is smaller but clothing customization is limited in the shirt category since you're only allowed to wear a school uniform shirt. The limitation is very noticeable in terallize battles and makes me miss Sword/Shield's customization."

  ",6,"With the 9th Generation of Pokémon we are finally beginning to see the foundation of what a truly next generation Pokémon game could be, however it is done with the presentation, graphical fidelity, and performance of an **** porn game. Compared to what a game of this caliber should be, this was a tech demo.

I was truly ready to write this game completely off, until the very last leg of the game where it began to bare it's fangs. To be quite honest, the whole game should just be structured like that last portion. In fact, I feel like the game would have been better off for it. That doesn't mean that you couldn't have wide open areas to explore and find Pokémon. I feel like a true middle ground could be reached if in the next generation of Pokémon they went the route of Xenoblade Chronicles and had massive areas interconnected with one another instead of one giant map that must be loaded in at all times. The world of Xenoblade 1 manages to still feel massive and interconnected despite it's loading zones.

Performance aside, there are a lot of problems I have as a long time Pokémon fan that I would like to see addressed. Not nearly enough post game, no difficulty options, missing features that we've literally had since the GBA, A lot of the Pokedex still missing to likely be sold back to us.

While Area Zero was a blast to play through, after I was done with it I couldn't help but feel frustrated at how I had to sit through hours of mediocrity just to get to the good part. The whole game should be the good part. While I did have fun doing menial things prior to Area Zero. Looking back I can't help but wonder why there was such a clear difference in effort in these two parts of the game.

I love Pokémon, the series is a jewel and I know everyone wants to see it shine. We keep telling them how to polish it, but for some reason the jewel keeps getting rubbed in the dirt. Area Zero was the feint glimmer of hope shining off the jewel, reminding me that with polishing, the highest grossing media franchise on the planet could release something they can be proud of."

  ",2,"I have a lot to say about this game, but I will just give the gist here; It would be amazing if it was finished. My reasoning is here:

The Pros:
The attempt at open world wad a good one, and the size of the game and the many things there are to do are amazing. The storyline really did captivate me and I adore the character designs and their personalities. A lot of effort was put into this game and it would be even better than Arceus if it had been completed. Picnics and sandwiches are amazing and very fun. Terratalizing is an awesome addition, up there with mega evolution(but not better!), and the new mythical and regional forms are some of my favorites in the franchise(though i wish there were more regional forms and future/past pokemon!) The Cons: The raids are very badly done. The timers go down with major penalties when someone gets knocked out as well as the person getting their own time penalty. When pokemon put up the shield, sometimes they are impossible to harm and you lose. Sometimes raids will just pause for a full minute with the time going down. There are so many glitches that half of the time, raids are impossible to do at all, if you can even get into any, since the online raid joining is a mess and does not update more than twice per minute when most raids are full within 3 seconds.

The frame rate is awful in the game. Pokemon just spawn underneath you while you're running and they're hard to see. Most pokemon are extremely tiny, even smaller than the grass blades and impossible to see.

This leads to the SHINIES. The shinies in this game are absolutely awful, not creative at all. Most, you can't even tell that they are shiny, which makes shiny pokemon extremely hard to find already. But to add to this, they removed the shiny sparkle and sound that every single other game had, which makes it hard for people who can properly see, and impossible for color blind people to shiny hunt. It's a horrible oversight that excludes an entire group of people with disabilities. For some more cons; there are no new animations for battles,  the lag is awful and causes the game to barely work, my switch overheats within ten minutes of playing and i need to set it down in sleep mode so that it can cool down, they took out many quality-of-life updates from past games."

Pro: Open World, can take on gyms in different orders, and trainers are finally optional. Can play at your own pace, skip Team Star if you want, even skip gyms and just go for Titans. 400 Pokemon, and some of the new ones aren't lame.

Cons: NPC's more than 30m away literally move at 1 FPS, it's actually really bad. Shadows from mountains also ""jump"" past you in a very noticable and distracting way. Online raids are broken, rooms take 30s to join and are usually filled. It's also really short at 28 hours to beat, but then again I skipped most of the trainers.

Overall, a really fun and ambitious Pokemon. Geometric texture mapping make the scales and fur on the Pokemon look more real. This feels like a natural evolution for the Pokemon franchise and I enjoyed it, but it just feels incomplete.

If you're a fan of the old ds games, please don't pass this up. Yes, rock texture ugly, yes, lags out... but the core of the game has so much spirit and personality to it that I havent felt with Pokemon in years. I'm a modern pokemon hater and I can't believe I almost missed out on this because of what people were saying. The characters are beyond great, the pokemon look better than they ever have (even the new designs) and the story is on top with white and black. The map and town designs are fundamentally good, even if they could be fleshed out more. Not even going to mention the music since it's always a given that its going to be amazing, haha.
It's just plain fun. It's so much fun. I know in my heart this game is a seven or six but I just can't give it that, I had such a good time playing. If you dont want to give money to nintendo, get it used like me, but I think it's the best game we've had in a long time. Even if just for the story, you really can't go wrong. Everything broken in this game is entirely fixable, the heart of it is very solid and reminds me so much of the earlier entries before the 3ds. I have my gripes with Scarlet but nothing that made my time feel permanently ruined.
.
By the way, If you want to talk about Game Freak, i suggest you learn about their actual situation as well as some basic critical thinking skills first, the devs themselves have absolutely no say in what time these games come out and in what condition. They're very clearly not just lazy, as so many people like to throw around. Pokemon is now linked to a horrible cycle of plushies, cards, anime, and other types of media... it sadly isnt just a game anymore, but an accessory to a product. There's so much wrong information about what is going on that it's baffling. If you want to blame anyone (you absolutely should), blame TPC and Nintendo more for forcing it so much to the benefit of no one but their arbitrary schedule. But I'd be more concerned about the people who make these games come out so fast, rather than the condition it's released in. If it's between going home and getting some rest, or making a rock texture look good, you know what anyone would choose in a crunch situation. Pokemon needs more time, period. Nothing else can fix it."

I often think that Game Freak literally 'finished' and I use the word finish loosely and then released it without any testing or quality checks. I am stunned that Nintendo would allow this game in this state on their systems. The Pokémon Company have acknowledged the technical and performance issues. Yet here we are on December 12th, they have released one patch that only fixed the Pokémon not closing their eyes when asleep and music not playing correctly. Game Freak couldn't care less about the issues. They probably only released that patch and a statement about the performance problems because Nintendo were giving them a hard time, deservedly so."

  ",7,"It's not a bad game... Honest!

I really wish I could score this game higher and I know a lot of people feel the same way. There were a lot of expectations and nearly all of them fell short and feel like a missed opportunity.

First of all let's hit hard, performance. Oh boy did they really mess up here. I've seen more advance games run better on weaker platforms so there no excuse. Zelda BotW on the WiiU runs better than this and I played that from start to finish (+DLC) so I know. Now don't get me wrong, in the main wild areas there is little faults in performance but then you get so many glitches it still takes away from the experience. I've fallen through the floor more than once and others have had worse. It's not all bad and definitely patchable but GameFreak need to step up.

Open world is a lie. I don't mean this to seem harsh but they could have done this better in so many ways. 3 Stories to complete but, in order to actually enjoy all the stories and not be caught short in level, or be overpowered, you have to follow the route the lead you on. This game could have done with a level scaling system based on badges earned. Want to do the Titan storyline first, ok but the gym leaders and Team Star will gain more levels on their teams for each badge you earn. Want to become Champion, cool, however the titans grow in difficulty. Each badge should be attainable at whatever point in the game but the next one should be a challenge. I've felt the sting of doing things out of order and I was overlevelled for gyms and underlevelled for titans. Level scaling can be done, I've seen it in other games too. And as for Nemona... Please, for the love of everything, let me set up my team first before you pounce on me again.

The Story progression. I have no problems here. Lots of heartfelt stories, lots of comedic segments and even a few cliché moments but, all in all, a good time. I was really impressed with the Titan storyline and the champion path was a good time too. Even the team star story has more depth than I expected based on previous titles. The game doesn't fall too hard. You can't cater to all tastes but they really tried to do something for everyone.

Battling and Grinding. This game handled this fine. You have to grind a little bit with enough trainers in the wild areas it was never too much and there were many new Pokémon to collect. Experience share should definitely have been optional but that point is well shared before now. Some Pokémon didn't give you a chance to get away and you were stuck in a battle loop with the aggressive ones. A moment of invulnerability to run away if you didn't want to fight would have helped but, overall, not really an issue.

Overall - this game is not bad. Is it great, no! It has some glaring issues and was released before it was ready with some amazing oversights that could have improved people's overall enjoyment. Is it a bad game, no! With a great storyline and in depth characters this game shines when it gets there and you take a moment to really feel what's going on. This game is a mediocre experience and, for all intents and purposes, is a Pokémon game at heart. Battles, gyms, evil teams and a rival have always been a thing, add to that the Titan story and you have a fully fleshed out experience if you can look past the other issues.

Does this game deserve the bashing it's getting, no. People wanted more, I get that, but this isn't a bad game! It's lacklustre and upsetting, especially to long time fans, but it doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving!"

What we missed in every Pokémon game in the past was the open world. Now we have the open world and finally you can choose your own path, and go where you want to go.

The ""bad graphics"" are mostly in the open world area, but the character models of the trainers and the pokemon are very good.

In this game you have  three storys like in every other Pokémon games, these are:
1. Gym battles and league.
2. Battle against the evil team
3. Beat the boss Pokémon
But they did it very good, the story telling and the personalities of the main characters and the pokemon are very nice.

Collecting all the pokemon is more fun as in legends arceus or shield & sword.

  ",0,"Pokemon is the highest-grossing media franchise on the planet - they should be ashamed to release a game in this state. Without the crippling technical issues (even in handheld mode!), the game would easily be one of the best in the series, right after Black/White 1 and 2 in terms of story.

But constant framerate dips way below 20 fps, pop-in centimetres in front of the player, animations that reduce to 2 fps or even 0 fps (static) literally right next to the player, extremely bad shadow handling, etc, pp. make this just atrocious to play.

I'm not a graphics nerd and Pokemon has certainly never been renowned for state of the art graphics. But if a new flagship game not only looks worse than most PS2 games, but also has extreme performance issues, that is just unacceptable.

Give these games more time to mature, a better team to help development along (as has happened before in the franchise). And, above all, quality over quantity. It is truly sad how Legends: Arceus was criticised for technical shortcomings, yet next to Scarlet/Violet looks like Far Cry."

The new Pokemon, especially the ancient ones, are interesting. The graphics are an huge improvement to SW/SH and Legends. The difficulty level is better than it was in years.
But: the performance issues really hinder the game experience. It took me three weeks to finish the game. Not because I didn't love it when I played it, but because sometimes I just couldn't play it. It slowed down so much, that it took ages to select a pokemon or run to a different place that I had to stop before I could reach the next destination. Sometimes it just shut down - autosave was the only reason I didn't have to do large parts of the game twice or trice.
I really wish that Pokemon Company had saved this game for next year and fixed this issues. It is a shame when a game loses much of the enjoyment because the technical part of it is **** when everything else had gotten so much love."

  ",8,"Es difícil hacer una valoración de este juego, ya que como Pokémon nos tiene acostumbrados últimamente, hay aspectos en los que sobresale y otros en los que es nefasto.
No voy a incidir mucho sobre el apartado técnico y el rendimiento, que evidentemente penalizan el resultado final del juego y son inaceptables. Voy, sin embargo, a destacar otros puntos negativos que se han visto algo opacados por esto, como la no existencia de una curva de nivel, que en un videojuego de mundo abierto es incomprensible, ya que deja al jugador a su libre albedrío, haciendo que se rompa en gran cantidad de ocasiones la sensación de reto o la dificultad; la eliminación de algunas mecánicas del ""Leyendas: Arceus"" que hacían al juego mucho más dinámico, como la captura libre;  o el hecho de que no se haya traído de vuelta la cámara lucha, cosa que sigue sin tener explicación y que hace más tedioso el acceso a un competitivo que, espero, esté mucho más controlado por parte de TPC que en el caso de Espada y Escudo, donde introdujeron una mecánica rota (Dinamax) y acabaron creando un metajuego excesivamente centralizado y aburrido.
Sin embargo, ahí acaba lo propiamente malo. La dirección artística de este juego ha paliado, aunque no del todo ni mucho menos, los enormes defectos gráficos del juego, y es que ha mejorado mucho respecto a un Leyendas: Arceus donde había árboles de bayas sueltos que no pegaban ni con cola, entre otras atrocidades que restaban inmersión. La historia es, en este juego, un punto fuerte a destacar, siendo en mi opinión la mejor desde los juegos de la quinta generación, tocando esta además una serie de temas muy maduros e interesantes, como el acoso escolar, la relevancia de la figura maternal/paternal o el sentido de la vida; todo ello de una manera ingeniosa y dejando al jugador misterios por descubrir que son esenciales en Pokémon, ya que avivan ese espíritu curioso que habita en todo entrenador. La jugabilidad, por su parte, es en líneas generales bastante buena, como en todo juego de Pokémon: la mecánica de la teracristalización es interesante (quizás algo rota, pero confiaremos...), y hay muchas mejoras ""quality of life"" que mejoran la experiencia jugable, véase la cura rápida. La banda sonora es excelente, como siempre, y sí es cierto que en cuanto a diseño de Pokémon, desde mi punto de vista, se empeora respecto a Pokémon Espada y Escudo (aspecto en el que estos juegos tienen un nivel altísimo), aunque aprueba con creces de igual forma, dada además la gran cantidad y variedad de nuevos Pokémon y formas alternativas introducidos.
En resumen, es un juego que merece la pena jugar, y que tras su brillante historia ofrece un sinfín de cosas que hacer, adaptadas a todos los gustos (""shiny hunting"", Pokémon competitivo, completar la Pokédex...). Ofrece una experiencia muy entretenida, siempre y cuanto estés dispuesto a pagar el precio de soportar las caídas de FPs y los bugs, que están por todo el mapa (todavía)."

Después de 30 horas de juego. Este cumple en el aspecto jugable, pero resta demasiado los errores técnicos que terminan lastrando la experiencia e inmersión provocando uno que otro bug que no justifica su valor de USD 60. Quizás si hubiesen atrasado el lanzamiento a Enero o Febrero, se hubiera mejorado su rendimiento y evitado la sensación agridulce del lanzamiento.

LO BUENO
- Modo captura y farmeo experiencia.
- Seudo mundo abierto decente.
- El concepto de recompensas de la pokedex.
- El mapa paldea es bastante interesante y dan ganas explorar, pese a los bugs.
- Los entrenadores ya no te agobian sino que tu decides si los enfrentas.
- El post game es mas interesante y ofrece mayor reto que la sendas de la historia principal
- El foso de paldea que es la única instancia para conocer el trasfondo de los 3  NPC principales.
- La simplificación de las pokemonturas.
- Facilidad para obtener Shinys.

LO MALO
- Comida NFT que da cringe con la animación.
- Lideres de gimnasio que carecen de carisma y dificultad
- Alto mando ridículo y soso.
- Rival patosa y sociópata.
- Bugs que merman la experiencia.
- Modo competitivo roto por bugs y estadísticas chetadas.
- Team Cringe (Star) cuya ruta es la mas tediosa y sus personajes rayan en lo patético.
- La música es bastante Meh! salvo los temas del team Star.
- La ropa de niño pijo del protagonista.
- Falta personalización en vestimenta, cada tienda ofrece lo mismo solo que con otro color.
- Ciudades sin alma ni presencia en el mapa Paldea. Cada ciudad no ofrece nada relevante y son muy olvidables.
- Pokemon de Paldea no son interesantes, salvo los bichos del foso.
- Tera cristalización no aporta nada relevante, si solo hubieran dejado la cristalización sin gorros no seria tan poco inmersiva.
- La canción de los créditos que le resta epicidad al esfuerzo de terminar el juego  y que lo convierte en algo mas genérico. Teniendo temas como el del Team Star que haría mas pasable verlos ya que no se pueden saltar y lo otro es silenciar TV.
- Problemas de texturas y de cámara durante los combates.
- Evolución de Finizen a Palafin es un problema sino cuentas con gente en circulo unión.
- Circulo Union ,Modo Online cooperativo, suele producir errores críticos que crashean el juego o bugean texturas. (Recomendable deshabilitar autoguardado para evitar que se corrompa partida)
- Las clases de la academia son irrelevantes, no aportan mucho a la experiencia y esta desaprovechada .
- La zona DLC que no tuvieron el descaro de esconder e incluso se puede visitar con el Glitch del agua bajo el mapa o ver con el bug de la cámara. (Es la zona gris con líneas punteadas).

The game is a mess, not just because of the disgusting state it was released.

We were sold on freedom of playing the game in any way we choose, this was false.

Areas all have level variances so do gyms, titan Pokémon, team star bases etc.

The experience does not scale to your personal progress, which would have made the games actually great, since you get badges for completing elements of the game those badges should affect the levels of the content you play, but NO! They took the easy lazy option, what's worse is the Pokémon centres are supposed to guide you through the content to give you a smoothe experience but they send you to content that's closest to you regardless of what level you are, it's not good...

To play the game and have half a decent experience you need to use a guide to follow the true route, oh and you thought you could skip doing certain content you don't want to do because it's monotonous and boring? Guess again, you have no choice but to do it because you need to do it all to complete the main story.

Honestly I've been playing Pokémon  since the beginning in the 90s, the switch games have been a slap in the face, hoping things will improve in the next game, that GF actually listened to feedback and would correct their mistakes, but nope, they've gotten lazy and complacent and worse! because they know their game will sell record numbers regardless.

Obviously the big elephant in the room is that the performance is pretty terrible.  In my 65 hour play through I never had a crash but the draw distance is really bad, the environmental textures are super low res (but the pokemon textures actually look pretty good, particularly for the steel type pokemon), and if you get in a battle on even a slight incline the camera clips through the ground.

  ",3,"Pokemon Scarlett is a game that seems to have been made by passionate programmers/artists/designers, but rushed and released unfinished. You will buy it because it's Pokemon, but the product is of overall low quality. The open world is beautiful, the battles are enjoyable, the gym leaders interesting, the story multifaceted and engaging. All of this is tarnished by poor performance.

There is a plethora of bugs. I'll break down the bugs into three categories below.

Unavoidable & understandable: there are many times where the game slows down. For the minor instances these are understandable as many Switch titles have difficulty maintaining an ideal frame rate due to limited hardware. Additionally, distant characters will appear at varying levels of choppiness. Say you are next to a character, they move smoothly, you move 15 steps away and they are moving at 12fps, you move even further and now they are moving at 3fps. These are annoying and feel unpolished, but I could understand these being necessary to establish a smooth frame rate.

Immersion breaking: there are several scenes, notably in school, where the obvious choppiness of the characters moving at only a few frames per second, distracts and detracts from the immersion of the game and diminishes the gameplay experience. If this was an intentional feature, they should have used pre-rendered videos rather than a live display. Here you are learning about math and these robotic children around you keep jittering around. Another issue is the at times extreme slowdowns. I've had the game freeze for several seconds, I've moved at far less than half of normal speed for 5-10 seconds, I've had cutscenes display improperly due to not rendering correctly. These are unacceptable and we are owed them being fixed.

Game breaking: I've had several instances where loading screens never load. I enter a city, I'm looking at a blank loading screen, a minute goes by, then five, then ten. I have to close the game and relaunch it to play it. Additionally, seemingly at random times, the game will crash. This can be: mid battle, when running around, when entering a new area. It doesn't happen often, but I've never had a Switch game experience crashes like this. Something is not right.

The story is pretty good overall, but poorly executed. Early on in the game you are given three main paths to pursue. All of them are necessary overall to advance, but you can do them in different orders. There is Team Star to pursue and beat to take down their bases, There is the option to pursue the Titans (which unlocks new areas to travel to), and lastly there are the gym leaders.

One area that the game lacks is direction. It seems like they wanted the game to be open and more free than previous Pokemon games, which is great, but they also have linear elements to the story which prevent this. Example: early in the game you are presented with two options: travel West and earn gym badges, or travel East and pursue Titans. This is misleading though. Both directions contain both titans and gym leaders of undisclosed difficulty. I chose to go West, and encountered higher level gym leaders. I got a few gym badges, then came back to head East only to encounter a gym leader with Pokemon nearly 20 levels under me. In no way was it suggested that I should start with the Eastern gyms. While it's great that you have some freedom in the order that you battle the gym leaders, the lack of direction provides an unnecessary hurdle. If the intention was to have a game where you wander wherever you please and battle whatever gym you came across, then the gym leaders should have dynamic levels. Say that the first gym will have Pokemon lvls (10, 10, 11, 12), the second gym has Pokemon lvls (14, 14, 16, 16), this should be the levels of the Pokemon no matter who you fight. If your second gym is the Ghost leader, or the Fighting leader, or Normal leader, all of their Pokemon would be the difficulty that a second badge should be. If they wanted the game to be open but varying in difficulty depending on where you go and when, they should have given clues as to what path leads where. I do like the game overall, but it was delivered in a very poor condition to consumers. It's a game where I feel in six months it will have many issues ironed out, but I disapprove of the business model of ""release a broken title and hopefully fix it later"".

If you are not in a hurry to get this title, I suggest you wait until they iron out the bugs so that you can have a nice gameplay experience."

Best story. The open world is gorgeous. The multiplayer is excelent. This is the direction Game Freak should push. And I'm afraid that, with all this internet trolls that didnt even play the game, we could return to those linear 2.5D games.

This is in addition to a wide array of fantastic new Pokémon designs and new ‘Paradox Forms’ which are a great idea to switch up the norm. Unfortunately, this game is let down by the frustrating performance issues which are inescapable when playing, from the Windmill in Artazon to Pokémon lagging in the wild, the game is extremely hard to watch and is not as pleasing to the eye as Pokémon Sword and Shield.
This being said, Pokémon Scarlet is a fantastic of example of how to structure a main series Pokémon game, but also of how important the performance of these games are. Overall however, the game is extremely enjoyable and is a worthy addition to the series."

I found playing the game in handheld mode helped make a lot of the bugs less noticeable and i was able to play the game and enjoy it well enough. Playing on my 4K Samsung TV was out of the question however. All flaws where on full display and caused me headaches.
If not for the bugs and the inability to play in docked mode, this would be a 9/10 game for me. The open world is a massive step up for the series, but the lack of scaling detracts from this improvement.
Overall, I rated this game a 6 because I did have a lot of fun playing the game, although it could have been improved with level scaling to give it a more ""choose your own adventure"" feeling.

  ",9,"This is an 8.5/10. Other reviewers have said it well, but I'll recap their points.

This game has some of the best writing for a pokemon game. I don't want to blow this out of proportion, it's not Mass Effect or Portal, but I actually cared about several characters. Compare that to Arceus which had me saying ""Shutupshutupshutup"" with the A button whenever anyone forced me to listen to their drivel.

It has a massive pokedex.

Moving around is fun, and you can quickly go to the action. You have a lot of choice how you want to play.

With a title this contentious you knew there'd be cons, so here we go:
-A lack of level scaling makes some gyms trivial, and lack of information can make it confusing to know which is the right destination for a challenge.
-Outfits, a staple of several previous games, are severely lacking. Hats, gloves, boots, are available but you need to keep your dumb orange-red school uniform. You can't even change the colour.
-Some technical glitches. The graphical ones are most noticeable and common, with stuttering windmills or terrible walking animations very common. I have also had two crashes so far, and am most of the way through the game. One had no problem (autosave is frequent), the other required me to re-do a gym fight.

Overall:
Game Freak made Improvements in many areas, while dropping the ball on what should have been easy things to spot in development. For me, it's familiar Pokemon comfort food, but I understand why others are upset."

The pop-in, the dropped framerate, the terrible slow loading of assets when switching camera perspectives (such as when throwing a Poke Ball at a wild Pokemon in combat) are all jarringly bad and constant.

I'm sure things will improve somewhat over time, as they at least want to iron out most of the performance issues, but even if they actually FOR ONCE fully fixed a Pokemon game to run well instead of just being good enough (PLA still crashes the game when shiny Giratina uses its signature move, btw; every single time), it is still UNACCEPTABLE for a game to be in this state at launch. There is no reason to have pushed this game out this soon in this state instead of just taking more time to develop it.

The story is vanilla at first but really kicks up a notch too. Unfortunately though, the performance of the game is distracting. The character models look amazing, but the world looks like it was handed over to the interns, which ruins the immersion.

Taking on the story in three separate arcs to then watch them all beautifully come together at the end gave this game an emotional finale and was a fantastic payoff. It is a truth that these games continue to become easier, so I have mixed feelings on the fact my Pokedex is almost finished after a week of playing. At the same time however I’ve always found catching Pokémon to be more exciting than evolving them, and to that end this game provided a continuous joy all the way until the end.

I’m fine with the wide open countryside for this region in particular since it fits thematically, but I want to see them do something this big and fill it with more vibrant cities and dynamic landscapes. Even so, it blows my mind just how open the world is with no loading zones and the complete third person perspective. Even as recently as 10 years ago if I was shown glimpses of this game and was told this would be a future Pokémon game I would not have believed it. Open fields with Pokémon running around organically, watching and interacting with you in different ways, and a multiplayer that lets friends join in with you with very few limits?! This is truly the start of something incredible and I’m so excited to see where things go from here! Pokémon has once given me another generation I’ve enjoyed.

The open world stuff is pretty nice and the branching stories was something that was at least a little more unique in comparison to past games with only the 8 gyms and that's it. Plus the story gets pretty dark by the end of the game that caught me by surprise. However this game is almost unplayable due to how it runs and the sheer number of glitches and bugs the game has. Even outside of that, the changes to all the new online components in raids makes me not want to touch any sort of online component whatsoever, especially since playing those raids solo is not only very doable but very much preferred as there's not a crazy new form to find here as the Tera forms are probably the worst gameplay inclusion I've seen in these games since the Z-Moves. I really wanted to like this game and put as many hundreds of hours into it shiny hunting and raiding like I did with Sword and Shield but, now that I completed the pokedex, I can no longer find the drive to continue playing this game like I did previously.

El final del juego es lo mejor que ha ofrecido toda la franquicia y los personajes me parecieron carismáticos, por otro lado, la idea de la teracristalización me pareció una excelente mecánica de juego que enriquece las estrategias de batalla, especialmente en el competitivo.

En general es un buen juego, disfrutable y que ofrece cosas nuevas como el mundo abierto, una mecánica más interesante que la de la generación pasada y una historia que no solamente es interesante, si no, que también tiene un mensaje positivo para los niños."

With such a large world to explore, it opens up the franchise in a completely new way. The characters are so lovable, and this game has brought a genuine smile to my face. Bugs can be patched, and they definitely will be, but in the end, this is a wonderful game."

  ",8,"This game has some serious flaws. On the day that the game released, I began to grow extremely concerned whilst waiting for my copy to arrive, with the games poor (and to be honest, often hilarious) bugs and glitches being shared on social media. But, now that I've finished the game, I can solidly say that this is potentially my favourite Pokemon game of all time, bar the Black and White games.

The open world aspect of the game breathes new life into Pokemon, and really allows you to explore and take things at your own pace - and the three different paths that the game allows you to take really allows you to personalize your experience. The characters and the Pokemon themselves are some of my favourites, and whilst I won't spoil it here, the story is amazing, and is the first Pokemon game in a long time to make me feel a real emotional connection to the characters within the stories.

Of course, the game is not without flaws - the performance is a massive downside of the game, although patches have partially improved these, and the graphics are sometimes poor, and don't always look like a game released in 2022. But, despite these flaws, I give the game a solid 8/10, with the performance flaws being the only reason it does not get a 9 or even a 10/10 from me. It may not be perfect, but it is certainly the right direction for the Pokemon series."

Unfinished, Lags alot, especially in the water and the Bambo Forest Area, really low performance.
Almost no creativity in pokemon designs ""Pawmi"" evolution line just gets bigger and stands up with little changes in design, Tandemaus is just ... more smaller rats;
The ""Wiglett / Toedscool"" ""Not BeiNG tHe sAMe pOKemON"" doesn t stick,  just say its a region variant
""Scovillain"" Great ideia but bad execution
You just slaped a heart on Palafin when it evolves and the method of evolution is so... wierd and random, just make a trade/item evolution (Great Abilitie tho)
""Flamigo"" its literally a flamingo... (Gamefreak be like: Flamingo take the ""N"" and its sounds like flaMIGO,  AMIGO in Spanish/Portuguese OMG im so funny and original)
It could of been more original like ""Flamingo, Flame+amigo Flameamigo"" i dont know and make him fire, fighting type...
Veluza just lookes likes a fish made of Metal
Past Paradox Forms are way better than the Future ones in design, but still no original ideias just changing the base design of the pokemon and giving it really random/bad names and not being able to breed them because they are genderless just because there from the past/future.
""Lechonk"" looks great but just evoles into a bigger pig
GameFreak just doing it on purpuse trolling Pokemon Fans giving ""Dunsparce"" a lame no effort/thought into a original design its again another evolution that he just gets bigger ""wow"" and has 2 forms for some reason
""Maschiff"" is again just a dog...
Tauros has 3 paldean forms and only the fire type one looks good, it would be better if it only had 2 for each version... but ok the base Fighting type is just a recolor that just slaped the color black and call it a day
And Squawkabilly another parrot pokemon that has 4 difrent ""forms"" colors only difrence is that the blue/green have ""Sheer Force"" as an Hidden Ability and the other 2 (white/yellow) have ""Guts"" as its Hidden Ability

Rival Nemona, Annoying like Hop, really dum and oblivious and choses the weaker starter and she is the class president of the school and achived champion rank... yeah right
Oh and the Eletric Gym Leader is just cringe

Atleast the story and Arven are not bad"

  ",7,"I really appreciate the effort to try to continue to shake up the Pokémon formula for the better, but even with the performance issues aside (which I did not find to be that bad), the execution was a little underwhelming. To address the performance complaints that everyone has with the game - the issues are there, but they literally do not impact the game by any means. I did experience some slowdown, I did experience a few bugs, but they weren’t bad enough to break the game or even hinder the experience. If you’re playing Pokémon for a next gen experience that performs at 60fps, then you are really losing touch with what the core attraction of Pokémon really is. I didn’t find the performance and glitches to be any issue at all.

However, the game itself feels like a step in the right direction with a very poorly executed concept. Open world Pokémon is exactly what everyone dreamed of since the Gameboy days. I just found the world to be incredibly uninspiring and hollow. I started off really excited to explore the map, but as I continued on I realized that the exploration just felt a little aimless. I appreciate that the game gives you many overarching objectives - completing the Pokédex, collecting all the gym badges, battling Team Star, and battling the titans gives some variety to the overall objective. But exploring uninspiring terrains just to find waves of the same Pokémon over and over somehow made the game feel linear in an open world. After awhile I found myself just going straight for objectives, not even caring about exploring. Which is a shame, because even Arceus felt like it had more push for exploration. It’s still a great game that offers tons of content. I just felt like the effort to move to open world was a bit weak, so it kind of took away from the existing magic formula that made the series great to take it in a direction that wasn’t fully fleshed out. After Arceus, it’s a step in the right direction, I just wish we didn’t have to wait another generation (or more) for the direction to be fully realized into what it’s capable of being."

The map is not fully accessible from the beginning unless you use glitches to reach later areas. Gym leaders' pokémon have fixed levels, that means if you like exploring different areas and catching pokémon before tackling gym challenges, you better be prepared to be greatly over-leveled. This takes away the feeling of ""choose your own route"" and trivializes any encounter as your team will most likely be way more powerful than your opponent's.
The story had some good points, but the awful performance of the game, the constant glitches and the empty cities, terrible npc model animations and constant dips in framerate overshadow every good aspect that the game might have had.

I noticed that Game Freak released a ""day 0"" update, so I got my game copy up to date... The suspicious thing here is that Game Freak recognized that the game may not be ended with the ""naked"" cartridge without the 1.0.1 update. What they actually were recognizing was that they ran out of time, so that they didn't finish the game at flashing cartriges milestone.
What I experienced at the really first hours playing Scarlet was that the game feels so laggy. Every time I open Pokedex the game takes 1 second or so with a kind of transition of laggy black screen, also when opening the Pokémon storage box.

Saying this about this game is very painful for me. I was expecting this game so much. And also have to say that the historiy, the enviroment and everything related to the game (without the technical aspects) is extraordinary. Brilliant. The score would have been much higher in my case just if Game Freak didn't just remove the Quality Assessment phase in their development.

They have published an update which fixes some of the problems. The game is 9/10 for me (not considering technical issues)."

Des textures horribles, des ralentissements et bugs, des choses évitables mais qui l'ont pas été.

Et c'est dommage car derrière, les jeux offre un bon open-world qui pousse à l'exploration. Un monde ouvert qui est généreux en objet, en Pokémon et en environnement. Un jeu qui offre également plusieurs quêtes intéressante, apportant parfois des nouveautés pour la série principale. Et qui se fini sur une quête très narrative qui nous transport dans une ambiance originale pour la licence. Le tout sur une bande sonore exceptionnelle et avec l'utilisation intéressante de la téracrystallisation.

Mais on peut également noté que la personnalisation est certes bien amélioré mais déçoit sur certain aspect. Que la difficulté non basé sur le joueur facile l'expérience de jeu. Et que les cinématiques manque de doublage pour qu'elles soient plus impactante.

En clair, Pokémon Écarlate / Violet sont de très bon jeu, qui propose un vrai pas en avant pour la licence Pokémon avec un bon open-world, mais c'est aussi des jeux qui souffre de leurs techniques.

Insanely poor graphics and performance even for the Switch standard, the pixel games were much more detailed and better optimized than this mess.

The lack of immersive quality, the towns, buildings, the npc's, just about every part of this open world game felt completely devoid of personality and life. Just a bunch of random poor quality textures and models filling this dull space.

I will say the Pokémon designs of this generation were interesting and fun to discover, if anything good at all in this game. But as for the gameplay and this terralization system, not so much. Nothing really innovative or well thought-out, just another quick gimmick that doesn't really do much for the gameplay. Yes you can change the Pokémon type with this mode and power up moves that share that type but that's it. No new move sets, no interesting compelling gameplay.

But it came at the price of a lot of cut content a empty open world : The citys have almost no building to enter and are very forgetable , the open world is empty that means no dungeons, no side quest, no structures that are interesting it only has the raid points, items and the Pokemon spawns

The performance is pathetic compared to the previous game Legend Arceus with frame dips below 10 , the render distance is a mess , tons of animations at 2 fps , bugs , glitches , crashes you name it the game prob has it

Graphic is even worse the AA is somehow negative or something , light is flickering everywhere , textures are cut of and pixelated af the only good thing are the Pokemon models those are pretty clean

post game is cut pretty short but what do we expect after what Masuda said about the missing battle area on ORAS ?

If i would go on about the negatives i would prob lose my mind now so ill leave it at that which is enought to not recommend this mess"

  ",9,"Imagine how I feel when I see this game, which is more enjoyable gameplay-wise and story-wise than other modern Pokémon games we got, receiving the worst critic score a core Pokémon game received ever. If it's true the technical issues were an unforgivable problem in this game that avoid then to be probably the best Pokémon games ever, its a big shame when the score is not fair when you compare it to the scores other Pokémon games received.

This game is a good step in the right direction that this franchise should keep in next games. These games make us wanting to explore every route and area more than once. The no-existence of linear routes makes the Pokémon experience more enjoyable and indirectly makes every event in the game (gym leader battles, titan Pokémon and team star bases) feel more important because the time span between events can be larger than simply traversing a linear route. Between events, the game invites you to explore the Pokémon world and look for the best event to challenge next.

As for the characters, all new characters are better written than other ones we knew in this franchise. I don't want to talk about spoilers here, but the plot feels more mature and talks about both Pokémon and its universe. The fact the Pokémon exist in their world is not the core of some of the stories makes the stories more endearing to live, which is fantastic because you can see other side of this world.

Again, the technical issues are a terrible reality (well, this and the lack of my favourite Pokémon, but I don't want to use it as a cons). However, this doesn't avoid me to talk about the good things this game had, not if other games that lacks of content and gameplay or had worse-written characters and stories got better scores. I'm afraid that these criticisms may be misinterpreted by the developers, since it's apparent that the real problem here is the lack of time to polish the game, which goes against the idea of ​​releasing a game per year. It's only matter of time to see if they understand the real problem of these games, I just hope they don't take a step back thinking that they can't handle with open worlds and mature plots that make the Pokémon universe a more interesting and beautiful one."

With frame rates dropping constantly (even within conversions and classes) and the archaic game design still being pushed (choices given in conversions mean nothing as even opting out of a task will result in either being asked to reconsider or flat out not let you progress without agreeing) this game feels like they half heartedly took on the complaints of fans and disguised another copy paste Pokemon game with open world exploration. With even this coming at the cost of it not holding up to being a polished Nintendo game we have come to expect (one of the only selling points of mainline Nintendo franchises). Nobody wins with this formula. Gamefreak have again taken another minute step in the right direction while still carrying a lot of the problems fans have been screaming to change.

  ",0,"In life, there's a common (and mostly right) consensus that opinions cannot be wrong. However, if there was such a thing as wrong opinions, the opinion of ""Pokemon Scarlet is a good game"" would be one of them.

The game is immensely flawed from whatever angle you look at it from. Whether that's from the dupe glitch that's infinitely repeatable, easily performed, and takes about 15 seconds to do; the countless out of bounds glitches, unintended sequence breaks, and slowdown; the difficulty of getting into online battles with it taking more time than it did in the BW era; or the disappointment once you do with there being only one rng seed. Hell, even the MUSIC is bugged. The game is disappointing in almost every single aspect.

As a long time fan of the series, I'm very familiar with the Pokemon Company's shtick of releasing a flawed, rushed game in time for the holidays because they know it makes them money. Knowing that, I set my expectations very, very low. The bar was in hell. And despite that being the case, TPC and Game Freak managed to somehow undercut those expectations by dodging the bar on the way down to hell, crashing through the floor, and finding some secret third place we've never heard of as a species before.

Normally I'd try to give some credit when it comes to characters, etc, but I don't think TPC and Game Freak deserve it this time. The game is a dumpster fire. Do not buy. Do not let what anyone says here convince you to buy. By the way, in case you missed this warning and bought it on release, friendly reminder: nintendo is giving refunds."

Sejamos francos. Estamos falando da franquia de maior sucesso do mundo em um console portátil medíocre. Mas mesmo assim, Witcher 3, Mario Odyssey e Breath of the Wild parecem bons, apesar da potência limitada. Por que esse jogo parece tão ruim?

A codificação, meu deus. É, além do pokémon do tipo inseto, crivado de quantidades infinitas de insetos. Falhas no sistema de batalha, bugs no motor de iluminação, bugs na textura, bugs na câmera. A performance é tão ruim que andar pelo mundo superior parece que o ar é feito de cola. As taxas de quadros cairão fortemente. Os tempos de carregamento são muito longos, mesmo em batalhas entre os movimentos.

Ainda não há animações de batalha como na era N64 Colosseum.

Não há escalonamento de nível real e com a fórmula de mundo aberto + ataques, você pode ser dominado em algumas horas, tornando o resto dos eventos da história do jogo triviais.

As pessoas pensaram que SwSh foi a pior tentativa 3D, mas Game Freak entregou e provou que eles estavam errados, esta é a pior.

Yeah, sure its got lot of bugs, and I mean A LOT of bugs, but its not like Cyberpunk 2077 first day where there a lot of game breaking bugs. People tend to ignore the game's core that are beside graphics which is the gameplay, the story, the innovation and the music when they are enraged, which will gave an incorrect review. So, to player who plans to read the review before buying the games, make sure the review is actually have some points in it and not something that just write by people who just try to review bomb it, positive and negative review. Alright, time to get to the main points.

With the 4 points I mention above, let's start with 1) The Gameplay:
The gameplay adapts some mechanics from Pokémon Legends: Arceus like backstabbing (yes, using your Pokémon's pokeball) and giving you a first strike advantage. Your riding Pokémon which depends on which version you purchased (in this case Koraidon) also got new overworld ability like Sprinting, Swimming and etc. which is also adapts from PL:A. This game is also the first Pokémon game to feature full-open world, with loading time only occurred on cutscenes loading and entering and leaving buildings. The level scaling, I can't defend this one, they have Nemona level scaling with your current gym badge and your champion status, but they can't level scale the gym and other wild Pokémon, but I still got a good laugh when my level 10 Quaxly suddenly battling a level 35 trainer, and you know what happen next, blacked out, lost some of my Pokédollars and back to Pokécenter. Speak of Pokécenter, this new Pokécenter absolutely fit the open world style gameplay. Need to heal, found a Pokécenter, heal up, go back to adventure, repeat. Simple and quick, no loading time except maybe the healing animation, which is also quicker than past games. And now, the new mechanic: Terastellize. By default, every wild Pokémon's Tera type is by their original's type, if it have two original type, its one of those as Tera type. There one exception for wild pokémon, there some Pokémon sparkling in the wild, and when you battling them, they will immediately Terastellize, which the Tera type is often not the same with their original type. You can also change your Pokémon's Tera type by defeating the Medali City Gym first, so you can talk to the cook and change your Pokémon's Tera type with 50 Tera Shards, which can found in the wild and as a Raid Rewards. Speaking of raid, it is time to talk about the Tera Raid. Some of the things in Tera Raid is adapts from SW/SH's Dynamax Raid, like the four players to raid and the Tera Shield. Now lets talk about new things in Tera Raid, you have 3 different Cheers skill and can only use 3 times combined in a Tera Raid, ""Go All Out!"" raise you and other player's ATK and SP ATK, ""Hang Touch"" raise you and other player's DEF and SP DEF and ""Heal Up"" heal you and other player's Pokémon;s HP and status condition. So carefully plan your cheers skill to help you and your team to win the Raid. Tera Raid use time now and not the Dynamax Raid's 4 fainting counts. And trust me, you will have enough time to win the raid even if there Pokémon get fainted a lot, not saying 7 stars Tera Raids though, you need a good team for that. Speaking of overworld multiplayer, I cant say anything about it because I don't have friends (Cry in the background), so lets move to the next points.

2)The Story
I'm going to be honest, this might be the best story alongside B/W's Story. I can't said anything here since its will be count as spoiler, but trust me, the story is very freaking good. My recommend steps to play the 3 paths is: Path to Legends => Victory Roads > Starfall Street.

3)The Innovation:
The ""Let's Go"" feature. Its a very good feature when you just want to exp grinds, since its save a lot of time to battle and wait for all the animation to finish, and its also wont beat the Shiny Pokémon so don't worry accidently kill a Shiny Pokémon with this feature. Now on to the things that is not new gaming innovation, but more of a Pokémon franchise's innovation, the full-open world which I mention above, so I won't talk about it again. The Riding Pokémon that is more improved version from PL:A, just one Pokémon and you can explore the entire maps (of course you need unlock the ability first which is in Path of Legend).

4)The Music:
Good ol Game Freak, still making banging music, and now with the help of Toby Fox, the creator of the popular indie games: Undertale and Deltarune. You will enjoy the music in this game.

Conclusion, the games will be, if not, the best Pokémon games if it without the bug that everybody angry for. So I recommend to play this games despite everybody being angry about the bugs, because underneath the bugs, its a gems. (I'm reaching text limit so no picnic part)"

  ",2,"I need to start off by saying my favourite video games of all time are Pokemon games. Pokemon Red and Blue (1998) were the first video games I ever owned. I think Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen (2004), alongside Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver (2009) are the best Pokemon games I have ever played.

It pains me to say this, but I do not think Nintendo is capable of making a good Pokemon game anymore.

Since the release of Pokemon Black and White (2010), Pokemon X and Y (2013), and Pokemon Sun and Moon (2016) the Pokemon franchise has been heading on a downward trend. These games when compared to their predecessors and contemporaries in the industry are lackluster, medicore products, seemingly selling their games based purely off of nostalgia.

Pokemon GO (2016), despite the popularity is the worst Pokemon game I have ever played.

The greed at Nintendo has led them to exploit their fanbase by releasing rushed and poorly designed games with massive technical issues.

I was extremely hopeful when the Nintendo Switch came out and I anticipated finally receiving a fun and beautiful new open world Pokemon game, similar to other fun, new, and beautiful Nintendo properties for the Switch. (You know the ones I'm talking about. The games that don't have 3.4 ratings on Metacritic.) But unfortunately the Pokemon games for Nintendo Switch, Pokemon Lets Go Eevee and Let's Go Pickachu (2018), Pokemon Sword and Shield (2019), and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet (2022) have been terrible games. These games are incomplete and far less fun than previous Pokemon iterations. I would NEVER recommend these Pokemon games on the Switch to anyone. I have never been more disappointed in a game then with Pokemon Sword and Shield, and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet turned out to be FAR MORE DISAPPOINTING.

The new Pokemon games are not 'triple A' titles, they are rushed, glitchy, poorly designed, graphically terrible monstrosities that Nintendo and GameFreak should be ashamed to ask full price for.

Because of these reasons, and the downward trend of Pokemon games over the past THIRTEEN YEARS, I feel as though Nintendo has exploited me enough, and I will not be buying anymore Pokemon games for the Switch.

I cannot believe a culture that is deeply concerned with shame would release such a disgraceful, imperfect product and then charge full price knowing very well that product is unfinished.

This comes across to me as though the people releasing Pokemon games, and the CEO's in charge have no shame.

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the fastest selling Nintendo games (within the first three days of sales). However, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have been so highly criticized for the technical issues that it seems Nintendo is now issuing refunds in response.

The fastest selling Pokemon games are being issued refunds for technical issues.

Think about that. That is shockingly unacceptable.

There will be no change in the culture at Pokemon until fans start letting Nintendo know exactly how they feel, I am protesting by not buying anymore Pokemon games. Nintendo can also have this review. "

  ",0,"Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are an embarrassment to the series.

This is by far the most disappointing Pokemon game to date taking several steps back from the features and quality previous games kept increasing.
I spent over 100 hours so far playing Scarlet so I made sure i wasnt going to give out a knee jerk reaction review but not much from my first impressions have changed over time.
Cons WAY outweight the Pros.

Shop and Houses interiors are gone. So is chatting with 90% of NPC. No exploring and chatting with villagers.
No forced trainer fights. I know this is a bit controversial but I do believe that forced fights are required in some scenarios to give a sense of accomplishment. I still think of the bridge with 5 trainer fights and at the end you get a gold nugget, big reward at the time, plus being able to go visit the professor.
Stuttering, Lagging and even Crashing during the entirety of my time playing. Whether it's exploring or even mid fight!!
The world itself is empty and soulless. It feels like they've made it open world JUST for the gimmick but didn't think at filling the world with any valuable things to do. The only things to do is catch pokemon and pick up junk off the floor.
Most animations are missing or just lazy. There are a few fight animations that are cool and impressive, like the terastilization crystal effect. But a lot of the moves have a generic animation that feels completely unrewarding. For example a Shadow Slash; a little twirl of dust and thats it. Using items have basically no animation at all.
Everything that's about 10 feet away from you runs at 5fps.
Terastilization gimmick is terrible. I can see why it would be fun for competitive play but when compared to Gigas and Megas, it's LAZY. They've modeled a ""Hat"" for each element and that's basically the effect. Your pokemon gets a hat. Compared to the impressive and cool variances in design you get with megas and gigas, it's the worst and the most lazy gimmick to date.
For the past few games the ""Evil"" groups have been becoming weird and unimaginative. In SwSh it was just a group of punks. And this game took it further and made it a high school gang. Not to mention the story around them and the boss/team designs is unimpressive. They should go back to evil groups destroying the world where your help actually mattered instead of trying to make some social commentary about school bullying.
Clothes? They don't exist. AT ALL. You're stuck with an ugly orange pants or shorts. This when compared to SwSh's AMAZING customization, they basically got rid of the entire feature. And it's a big shame considering Scar/Vi probably has the best multiplayer system in pokemon to date.
Gyms don't even have interiors! Nor do they have trainer battles for the most part and there aren't any puzzles either. Instead this time around they decided to add weird challenges, i.e quick time event test, or Where's waldo. Bring back the exciting, varied Gym interiors with custom music, puzzles to get to the leader and trainer fights.
NPC and Pokemon disappear in a very inconsistent manner. As soon as they're off camera, they could disappear entirely. I cross a couple in town and turn around? They aren't there anymore, nowhere to be found. Same for pokemon, and it makes for a horrible experience.
The new UI, especially the Battle UI is just horrendous and inconsistent. Mid fight you need to wait a minute during moves before you can see the enemy pokemon's health or how many pokemons the trainer has left.
The AI, LITERALLY, CHEATS. And it's obvious too. If you swap a pokemon mid fight, they will instantly change their usual move they used for the past 3 turns and switch to what's needed to be super effective on your new surprise pokemon. Also affected when using Zoroark in illusion form.
Pokedex is ugly but more important, tedious to use. Especially when trying to fill the pokedex and trying to see where they spawn. It gives you a bunch of blocks on the map but you can't put markers, it just lets you try to guess.
The multiplayer has crashes, simple as that.
Map zoom out doesn't let you zoom in and out where you want. It resets every time.
Raids are confusing and also a guaranteed catch? Tera doesn't feel as impressive as Gigas.
No Badges or much customization on your player card.
Elite Four is in a single, lazy blue room. And the Gym leaders/Elite Four themselves are pretty badly designed too.
During the game you get random heals, this ruins the challenge and doesn't make sense, especially when it's not mentioned in the cut scene.
Berry Trees and farming is gone.

All in all Scarlet doesn't even feel like a real pokemon game. It feels like a fan made game that was made in a month. It's still fun in a simple mindless, fill the pokedex way. But it's FAR from matching expectations from Pokemon. Can't even trust Pokemon, they've released it unfinished like the rest of the industry."

The world is vast, it's an actual open world game with three interesting stories to follow. The main characters of these stories are great, but everything around it kind of falls flat. The gym leaders are quite bland, the titans could've had a larger impact on the surroundings. Team Star is great, although the minigames of clearing out a base get repetitive and the final battle is quite boring too. The new Pokedex is great, a lot better than previous generations.

Roaming around has never been so fun while searching for new Pokemon in their natural habitat. The game is rewarding people to go around and catch as many Pokemon as you can, and filling up the Pokedex is a lot of fun.

Spoken about habitats, that's where the biggest downside of the games lies. The world is ugly. The graphics are on par with Colosseum and XD:GoD, the nature is empty and exploration doesn't really get rewarded with secrets or anything. The cities are bland and forgetful. The game runs horribly too, there is not a minute where I don't dip below 15FPS or some graphical glitch occurs. I've had the game crash on me twice, losing some hours of progress the first time as I turned auto-save off... Lesson learned.

Overall, it's a great direction the new Pokemon games go in. The open world aspect of exploration is incredible, and pokemon is the perfect IP to combine this with. But a big as a company TPC is, the game should not be this bad graphically and performance wise. The core of pokemon is still there, but the soul that made the other games so much fun is kinda getting lost in trying to make the 3D open world a possibility.

The graphics aren't that good when you compare it to other switch games. However, the game is one of the best Pokémon games I've ever played in every other department. The story is lightyears better than Sword and shield and the characters feel more alive when showing emotions.
Combat feels smoother than ever, auto battles is a great quality of life improvement, the difficulty is there and noticeable, especially towards the end. As usual if you over grind it becomes easy but that's not really the games fault.

While the performance is holding the game back from being my favorite Pokémon game, I don't care much for the graphics since they are mostly horrible in the background and it's way less important than gameplay and the system."

The design of the new Pokémon is, once again, hilarious and bad and I am not sure how the graphics could actually get worse from Sword/Shield, but they did. There are a lot of inconsistencies as well, like when you enter a cutscene from a certain direction, but once the cutscene starts, your character enters it from another direction.
However the worst part about this game is that there is no level curve. It's an open world game after all and when you beat the gym leaders in a certain order, you might expect that trainers in other areas will adjust to your level - but they don't. So at one point you may end up fighting PKMN-trainers with level 16 pokémon, while your pokémon are already past level 30. Just because you didn't chose the path the game intended for you - all while the game tells you at the same time, that you can chose any path however you want.

In all seriousness: Don't buy this game now. It's full of bugs and glitches and 60€/$ is way too much to ask for this experience. Wait until the next SALE in a few months, when it's patched, and then make your own opinion on this piece of crap."

L'open world est vide, t'as quasiment aucune quête, les 3/4 des maisons tu peux pas rentrer dedans, tu peux pas grimper partout et parfois tu vois un chemin sur la map qui en fait est bloqué par une colline donc tu refais tout le tour.

Es el primer mundo abierto REAL de la saga y eso hace que sea sin duda un juego muy divertido de jugar, además, poder jugar con tus amigos y recorrer Paldea juntos es una delicia con no demasiados límites que hacen que estos dos puntos sean los mejores del juego.

Sin embargo, la trama me ha parecido simple y sosa, me gusta que al menos sea coherente, pero ha sido una trama bastante ausente durante el 90% del juego. Todo ocurre básicamente al final, y lo que ocurre tampoco es que sea muy bueno, aunque sí es mejor que otras tramas de la saga como las de 8ª generación o 6ª. Tampoco me gusta el balanceo de niveles. El juego no tiene un crecimiento de niveles coherente, lo que provoca que superes antes de tiempo, sin querer, gimnasios o pruebas que aún no debías (porque realmente se superan fácilmente, es Pokémon), esto hace que todas las pruebas anteriores se vuelvan extremadamente fáciles y aburridas de superar. Si van a seguir creando mundos 100% abiertos, la saga necesita urgentemente un escalado de niveles, o al menos, un diseño de niveles coherente y natural por muy libre que sea. Tampoco me ha convencido la gran falta de postgame, que esta vez es real.

A pesar de mi problema con los niveles, la trama o el postgame, el juego es en general muy divertido, me parece una buena primera experiencia de Pokémon en mundo abierto y creo que van en buen camino para crear el posible ""Pokémon definitivo"" con el que todos soñamos.

Honestly a disappointment with the company, this game is not even worth half of its value and here I leave my note of repudiation."

They really need in markers on your screen to show your party members location and minimap instead of opening the map with Y (which takes a while to load currently). I quite enjoyed Legends Arceus where you could select your first pokemon on a whim to battle. In this version, you have to open your bags to swap around your line up which just ruins the flow of gameplay. You can customize your character with different hairstyles and facial features which is nice, but apparently you're stuck wearing 4 different versions of your school uniform which is disappointing. Character models at a distance have reduced frame rate, so their movement is quite clunky - though this is a rendering issue due to the hardware limitations of the switch.

Gameplay it's the rock paper scissors, so nothing new in that regard.

Seems to have a lot of content. I havnt encountered any game breaking bugs, though my daughter had her character lose its face and was walking around with eyeballs and exposed teeth which was humorous but creepy.

I'm hoping some software updates will improve the game to players expectations."

The story is entertaining and the three paths are well interrelated with each other at the end, plus we can consider that it is the first time that there is no real evil in the game. The Pokémon designs are generally very pretty, especially Scarlet's paradox. Lastly, even though the graphics are terrible, the game map design is relatively good. The only problem is that it is often too empty.  In short, the game's graphical and performance problems are unacceptable, but Game Freak still knows how to entertain from the point of view of the story and the designs of the Pokémon. For me a 6 is more than fair, but these problems cannot be repeated in the future."

All that said, exploring the game's open world and being able to tackle the three stories as I wanted, proved to be a really enjoyable experience. The game's three story paths, as well as the final ""true ending"" path that unlocks after finishing the first three, all combine to give Scarlet/Violet the best story of any main series Pokemon game. Granted, that's not really saying a lot, but this was the first time a Pokemon game actually elicited any emotions from me.

My disappointment started mostly with Generation 8, which was a fiasco overall, so my expectations on these entries were already rather low.
You are only in the first cutscene, and you're already experiencing frame drops, shadows that disappear,  even the player's house glitches out of reality when you see it from a certain angle.
I've been experiencing a couple of glitches here and there already, like Pokémon glitching into reality, or simply being obliterated out of it, game models doing the same as well and causing all sorts of weird stuff, like the player floating in the air, or pokéballs being levitated by poltergeists.
These games have the largest dex cut; even more severe than Sword and Shield. For instance, Vulpix is my favourite Pokémon, it is nowhere to be seen.
If you're a Shiny hunter like me, good luck with that. Shiny Pokémon do not make any special effect when they spawn like they did on Legends Arceus (until you engage in battle with them), or even have a sparkle effect like they did in Let's Go.
The initiative of making these the first open world entries was a bit too ambitious. If it were well-implemented, these would be bang-on... but even that was poorly implemented. The world is so open, that it's easy for you to get lost... both location-wise as well as losing track of whatever you were doing.
Alas, they're Pokémon games, they are still enjoyable to a certain extent... But still, these entries feel like an unfinished mess, even more than Sword and Shield, or even BD/SP, which were a **** of glitches when they came out..."

You have characters like the women brutes, the weird lankey predator looking mountain guy, the rapper gym leader which just felt… racey?

Pokémon are not unique anymore, you can find them at a later point in the game, and then they pop up more after your battle so you’re stuck into call of duty’s spawn kill situations.

I just rage quited on Twitch while playing this abomination called Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. This ""game"" is an abrasive paper for the eye and a laxative of good taste. It is literally the worst experience I had in more than 30 years of gaming.

The graphics are an imposition, the poor performance a kick in the groin for any gamer. Content has been removed (again) in favor of new content. And this new content works grotty. As a player, I'm unable to throw a Pokéball up a hill because the aiming mechanic of Legends Arceus has been taken out. The auto combat feature sometimes works or it doesn't. Ambushing Pokémon no longer has any appeal, as I can't throw empty Pokéballs either. I have to cancel evolutions every time I level up. In this texture mud, I repeatedly traipse over Pokémon that I just can't see. And the great audio feature that made finding Shinys in Legends Arceus easier is also gone.

The game character is an empty shell. Thirty years now I've been playing video games. And it's the second time now that I would have loved to hammer the A button in a role-playing game instead of drowning in this tidal wave of platitudes and these dull attempts at fraternization. Watching the unsightly slush that is supposed to represent grass grow is more interesting than any NPC I've run across. If you have trouble reading, you won't be served a soundtrack here either and will have to slog through text box after text box after text box.

NPC's move as slowly as the entire game feels. It's sluggish to the point of falling asleep. The open world has no appeal when I do end up being compelled to do exactly what you've been doing in Pokémon games for more than 25 years: collecting medals. Because exploring and finding new Pokémon is ruined by the leveling system. I can't go and collect and use whatever I want afterwards. Because I absolutely need a medal to control this new and powerful Pokémon. Exactly the opposite is the appeal of an open world. To venture into dangerous terrain and then take home some particularly good loot. But I can't have that very loot. No, I have to go back to doing what the developers want me to do. The freedoms are as limited as some rooms in this game. They have several doors, but I can't open them for unknown reasons, such as the door in my own house to the garden or the master bedroom. With this setting, there is no need for these doors in the first place.

Pokémon Violet and Scarlet is a sandpaper to the eye and a purgative of good taste. If there were an invective award for video games: This game would win the main category for two years. Because that's how long the experiences made will haunt one's nightmares."

It’s understandable since this game wasn’t ready to be launched and should have taken a couple more months or even all the way to next November. This would have given it enough time to fix and develop the game further than it is now but game-freak decided not to do that and it really really shows. Examples in the games are: will shut down randomly, characters will spaz out, Pokémon and people will pop in/out or glitch out, walk through battles and lose their bodies sometimes, you’ll fall out of bounds easily and that’s just some of them. Multiplayer is worse and will more likely have these things happen to the players. However, those aren’t the only issues. Graphics are not great either, low textures, low frame rates even in close distant, slow movement, and lighting/shadow pop in/out effect the gameplay. Customization is also limited, you may be able to do a lot with the face, hair, color, and certain parts of clothing but you can not change your uniform or it’s color. You only get 4 options for each season spring, summer, fall, and winter, you can not change these colors only orange if you pick scarlet and purple if you picked violet. The outfits are horrible looking and not being able to have more options or change tops and bottoms really takes you out of the game since you can’t really feel like you when restricted to these 4 outfits. Pokémon are no better, I’m sorry if I’m comparing to arceus but Pokémon don’t interact like they do in that game. In that game Pokémon would run away if you were not carful, don’t mind you around, and can be aggressive if you get to close or spot you, not to mention the way they interact with other Pokémon, people and the world around them. Scarlet and violet doesn’t make their Pokémon feel like that, they just pop in and out or in groups due to the low graphics they have been given and it’s not the system it’s game-freak let’s make that clear. They don’t intact much or show much characteristics that makes them feel like they belong. The lands are pretty barren with not much to do, the same with the towns since you can’t even go inside any bodies house which seems to be a trend now. No type of side missions or spooky lore to make the town feel alive which is just sad really. Over all this game needed more time to fix its bugs, glitches, frame rate, world interaction, online multiplayer, Pokémon interaction, graphical aspect, more expression with clothing, better towns/lands and a more thought out plan when allowing the freedom of the player roaming the world they build/created. If that means we would have to wait till next fall 2023 then I’d rather wait because it just feels rushed and a money grabbing game rather than a game I would enjoy for years to come like the gens 1 through 6. Hopefully they will fix some of these issues but it is too late for the others I have mentioned."

The story is amped up from Sword & Shield. By that I mean it’s much better. The characters are more fleshed out, and I actually like some of the gym leaders. I’m not going to spoil because it’s brand new.

It plays a lot like Arceus, which is good. There are some changes, my least favorite being the removal of the roll. You also can’t cycle between Pokémon just by pressing L or R. There is a new way to battle without going into a battle sequence, and it’s helpful. Yeah, the overall gameplay is very good. But the presentation….

The Switch is no powerhouse. Anyone who has played a ported console game will know. Scarlet and Violet does not look good. Adding insult to injury, it runs at like 15 fps. At the start it’s really noticeable, but everywhere else it looks fine. The soundtrack, however is stellar. Toby Fox composed some of the songs, and some sound like they’re straight out of Undertale or Deltarune. The presentation doesn’t bring it down too much, but it is a valid point.

It has tons of content. I don’t even know how long it takes to beat, let alone 100%. Whoever plays it will be satisfied with 3 different stories, Elite 4, and a post-game, I’m guessing. I personally think it is better than Sword and Shield. Pretty controversial, and someone could say it’s rushed. It has basic features, and comparing it to Mario Tennis Aces would be a bad idea. If you are planning on giving this to someone for Christmas, they won’t complain about it unless they’re 30 and live in your basement. The people who complain about it do have valid points, but I think it’s good, and it’ll probably be fixed later."

Half the fanbase forgive the series' technical and visual flaws and appreciate the premise of catching them all (not that you can ""catch em all"" any more within standalone titles). The other half, and the half of the camp I sit within, expect the largest franchise in the world to treat its IP with respect, and more importantly treat its fanbase with respect. Scarlet and Violet are no exception to this opinion. If anything, the issues presented this time around are WORSE than what people criticised with Arceus' arrival at the start of the same year.

Game Freak are not only too small a team to be expected to deliver the content asked of them, but their release schedule is far too crammed to deliver the quality of games expected of what should be the slickest, most polished looking gaming franchise there is out there.

The Pokemon Company need to pull their act together and provide Game Freak with the budget, team and time that these modern Pokemon titles need. Otherwise people can expect less and less quality from these bigger and bigger titles as time goes on.

Como fã de longa data da série, posso dizer que me diverti por algumas horas, mas seguramente posso dizer que não recomendo. Esse foi seguramente o pior jogo da série principal de pokémon que já joguei.

Falar das questões técnicas é chover no molhado, todo mundo está falando disso, e não é por menos, o jogo está desastroso tecnicamente, toda hora algum bug ou glitch te tira da imersão, e quando algo não está bugado, só está feio mesmo, com texturas em baixíssima qualidade, tudo isso prejudica a experiência.

Sobre o mundo aberto, é apenas uma ilusão, o level dos pokemons selvagens e ginásios não escala junto com o seu, e existem locais que você precisa de determinadas habilidades para alcançar, ou seja, existe uma ordem recomendada de caminhos a seguir, mesmo que escondida. Eu até tentei chegar em um lugar antes da hora, e fui barrado por uma mensagem ""você não pode vir aqui agora"". Todo o restante é repetitivo, principalmente as batalhas contra os líderes da equipe Star, todas iguais.

A mecânica nova é interessante, mas não acho mais legal que as anteriores, e visualmente ela é bem estranha.

Os desafios pré ginásio são fracos, sem emoção e não são divertidos (te fazem empurrar uma azeitona gigante como se fosse algo extraordinário), senti falta daqueles ginásios temáticos, só pela arquitetura e decoração você já sabia o tipo de pokémon que seu líder usaria, senti falta dos puzzles ou desafio de outros treinadores fortes até chegar no líder.

A liga também não tem emoção nenhuma, você praticamente conhece todos os integrantes dela antes de chegar nela, não tem uma surpresa ao enfrentar o campeão ou coisa do tipo. Não existem mais salas pra cada um da elite, você os enfrenta numa sala branca sem graça, e na minha gameplay a música travou, no clímax do jogo eu não pude ouvir a trilha sonora (muito boa por sinal), e vi que isso aconteceu com muita gente. E por decisão de algum infeliz, não é possível desafiar a liga novamente, sério, quem teve essa decisão? Sempre foi possível, por que dessa vez foi melhor remover essa feature?
E pra piorar, depois que você vence a liga não tem mais um Hall of Fame mostrando os pokémons que você usou.

Não existe mais uma caverna ou caminho cheio de pokémons fortes até você chegar na liga, você simplesmente entra no prédio e pronto.

O sistema de breed está uma porcaria, quem curte ficar fazendo times perfeitos pro competitivo vai se frustrar muito.

O ponto positivo fica por conta da trilha sonora e na ideia de alguns novos pokemons, que ficaram bem legais.

De resto, continuo recomendo o Sword and Shield como melhor pokémon do switch, com o ambiente mais acessível pra montar um time competitivo e com visuais infinitamente melhor do que esses do Scarlet, se for pra fazer um mundo aberto assim, prefiro os lineares do Sword."

Arceus made so many excellent steps forward, the open world, quick catching, the traversal, and the story being a bit more unique. Scarlet and violet removed the quick catch completely, the traversal is worse with the removal of the flight ability, and most of the story is the same as its been for the past 20 years kid get their first pokemon and a week later they are the strongest on the continent and did some insane feat. The giant pokemon fights from Arceus that had unique boss mechanics are gone they are now just normal fights with big pokemon. They have also gone back to the duel game releases where there's about 5% of unique content locked away in each version, and again you cannot get all pokemon for the dex without either owning both games or trading with other people, which was very welcomed in Arceus. Then there's the performance, my god it's so bad. I would constantly have to restart my game every 30-45 minutes because my games fps would just drop to the point it would just be a slide show, which at times would give me a headache to just look at, and the game isn't exactly pushing the graphics department even for the switch.
It's not all terrible there have been some changes and additions that I did enjoy. The new auto-battling was good and I regularly used it. The storyline for Arven was good and gave me the motivation to finish it. The world does have more buildings and structures in the open world which is a step up from arceus, but should still be improved in the future.
Then there's the stuff that was a good idea on paper but needed to be fleshed out more. The school system could have been really cool if they made the system deeper and centered the story more around being a student, at some point, I just completely ignored ever going to the school it never mattered. I liked the idea of the school bullying storyline for the bullies was a good idea but they just didn't get enough development time for the characters, the sections for the auto-battling got boring really fast too. The idea of the great crater was cool but i wish there was more of those ancient pokemon. The last bit of the story with Arven's mom was interesting but I wish more of the game utilized and spent more time with it.
I can tell the devs at game freak are trying to get creative with the pokemon games but they just don't have enough time and or devs to get it done. It's still a pokemon game and if you like pokemon I'm sure you're still going to enjoy it but for me, there are just too many systems that were great in previous games that got removed coupled with the absolutely horrible performance the best I can give it is a 4. Let's just hope the devs are given the resources needed to make the next pokemon game even better."

Cette fois-ci le jeu est entièrement en monde ouvert. On va directement commencer par les choses qui ne vont pas.
""Pokemon violet/écarlate"" est à la ramasse sur la technique, le jeu n'est pas spécialement beau, il a aussi des éléments du décors qui pop, le clipping est aussi présent sans oublier l'aliasing.
Le jeu souffre aussi de chute de framerate,  la Switch est capable de faire tourner des jeux plus gournands. C'est dommage car l'univers crée pour cette aventure est vraiment top. Cependant ""Pokemon violet/écarlate est probablement le meilleur jeu de la licence sur la Switch.
Le monde est assez vaste et dès le début vous avez la possibilité d'aller pratiquement partout.
Le scénario lui est un peu différent des précédents ""Pokemon"".
Le jeu propose trois intrigues différentes, dont la quête des champions d'arènes, que le joueur peut réaliser dans l'ordre souhaité. Vous devrez battre des Pokemons titans pour récupérer des épices spéciales. Cette fois-ci il n'y a pas la team rocket à vaincre, mais la ""Team Star"", vous aurez plusieurs bases à battre pour s'en débarrasser.
Et évidement il vous faudra aussi battre les 8 maîtres des arènes. Sans oublier la Téracristallisation.
La Téracristallisation est un phénomène qui transforme l'apparence d'un Pokémon, le rendant aussi étincelant et scintillant qu'une pierre précieuse. Sous cette apparence de cristal, le Pokémon reçoit une sorte de couronne sur la tête, appelée Joyau Téracristal.
Visuellement les Pokemons sont plutôt réussis, et il y en a beaucoup.
La transformation des Pokemons en téracristal est très chouette. Le gameplay ne change pas beaucoup par rapport aux précédents jeux. Vous allez rencontrer plusieurs personnages durant votre aventure et ces derniers sont réussi, ils ne sont pas trop présents. La petite nouveauté qui fait vraiment plaisir, c'est que durant votre aventure vous croiserez des ""PNJ"" qui attendront que vous alliez leur parler pour déclencher un combat, ils ne vous agressent plus et c'est plutôt agréable comme petite nouveauté. Pour conclure, malgré une technique vraiment pas top, ""Pokemon violet/écarlate"" est vraiment sympa, son univers et son histoire apportent un vrai renouveau à la franchise."

  ",8,"Un juego de pokémon que es un 10 empañado por un apartado técnico que le hace ser un 8.

La realidad es que es un videojuego muy divertido, jugable y mecánicamente me parece lo mejor que hay de pokémon hasta la fecha.

Te engancha a continuar con la historia, 3 líneas narrativas que son mucho más interesantes que en otras entregas. A la vez, te incita también a perderte por el mapa capturando pokémon o buscando los teracristales. Todo esto combinado hace que tengas distintas posibilidades para desarrollar tu camino como entrenador pokémon de la forma que mejor te parezca. En este aspecto tengo que añadir que me hubiera gustado que el juego hubiera implementado el autoleveo de los rivales, o al menos de los líderes de gimnasio, jefes del team star y pokémon dominantes, para darle una versatilidad casi perfecta.

En lo personal, el hecho de que esté ambientado en España y tenga guiños tanto a lo gastronómico como a las inspiraciones de muchos de los pokémon o el estilo arquitectónico de diversas ciudades, es para mi un punto a favor más.

Por último, también hay que hablar de lo malo, y es el apartado técnico. Gráficamente le falta un poco, lo pueden hacer mucho mejor, estoy seguro. El juego me ha crasheado 2 veces, los bajonazos de fps son notorios y he visto ciertos bugs gráficos y de cámara, pero esto no ha desplomado mi experiencia de juego. Al menos para mi, este apartado deficiente no me resulta excesivamente importante como para echar por los suelos todo el trabajo bien hecho que han realizado en la parte narrativa y jugable. Cabe destacar también que muchos de los bugs, glitches y cosas extrañas del videojuego que se comparten en redes sociales son de emulaciones o pirateos, lo cual tiene una validez nula.

En conclusión, el videojuego me ha encantado y lo estoy disfrutando como si fuera un niño jugando por primera vez a pokémon, me ha devuelto a la ilusión de mi infancia. Obvio que hay que quejarse de las deficiencias técnicas que tiene el videojuego, pero seamos serios, al igual que hacemos esto también se debe poner en valor todo lo bueno que tiene, que es muchísimo."

  ",10,"Honestly a promising game for the future of pokemon. Take negative reactions with a HUGE grain of salt. These people are generally whining and haven't even fully played the game as you'll hear many well known pokemon youtuber are in love with the game. I have played it and I really do enjoy it, it's the best pokemon game so far. Open world, just as I dreamed of. The last thing I need is for pokemon to take steps back because of people who don't know better. I loved playing the game, catching pokemon, and hanging out with friends in union.

Game: the game itself is fun, you have an open world, you can climb, fly, run fast (when unlocked). Does the game have issues ? Ofc it can lag a little at times but I didn't experience major glitches through my gameplay, leaving me to believe many people are seeking the glitches out to then complain. But you can expect some frame rate drops, but hey nothing some patches cannot fix ? The game is just out, patches can be expected. Graphic wise it's a huge improvement from legend arceus, Is it a mineblowing game graphic wise as some other games out there ? No, but to be fair pokemon has never been that the main idea behind pokemon was to have fun. So ofc compared to some other companies which far more impressive graphics you might feel like this is a let down. However I still found the game generally gorgeous to look at, and to me its a 100% improved from arceus, so pokemon is going in the right direction. The open world is def the big pro, and you can play your journey as you see fit.

Storyline: I'll be honest, the last pokemon games (except for legend arceus), got me downright bored with the storyline. 0% invested. But when playing scarlet I got invested a lot more! I love the story line. I think have the legendary be a ride creature is perfect! I didn't usually care about legendaries you could only obtain SUPER late. But you really bond with this legendary. I enjoyed the storylines, but def the crator of paldea was my favorite line! Storyline is great!

New pokemons: I'm glad for the many cool returning pokemons, sadly with how many humanoid pokemons we get these days the new entries of pokemons is probably the biggest minus to me ? I love feral looking animals, so sadly many didn't hit that mark for me, but there were some cool ones that can't be ignored! so this is personal taste.

In total,  play a pokemon game with what it is intended, to have fun! If you tell me your game barley runs, I honestly think your making it up just to bash on this franchise. I never had it happen that my game became unplayable."

Es el mejor juego de Pokemon a nivel jugable nunca hecho. Llevo 30h de juego y solo había sentido ese cosquilleo cuando empecé a jugar la saga con el Esmeralda y el Platino.

Me encanta perderme por el mundo abierto y explorar hasta el último rincón, por eso llevo 30h y todavía no he completado la historia.

Lo que llevo de historia me está gustando mucho, quizá la historia del team Star es la mas aburrida. La vía del campeón es normalita pero bueno es ganar los gimnasios y la liga pokemon me gusta, soy un clásico. Y la historia de los pokemon dominantes es preciosa mis dieces ahí.

Los pokemon en el mundo abierto se sienten mucho mas vivos e integrados que en el Arceus, aunque todavía haya mucho que mejorar si se siente que estoy en el mundo pokemon y eso me encanta.

El sistema este de lanzar al pokemon y que combata solo esta chulo, no me parece la revolución de la industria, pero oye es un añadido más que se siente fresco y funciona guay. Eso sí, las bases del team star de lanzar a tus 3 pokemon a porron es un toston, es literalmente moverte y pulsar la R, no he **** más de 2min en ninguna. Hay que darle una vueltecita a esto.

Los personajes son todos muy carismáticos, ayuda a amenizar las historias.

Para mi el juego, a nivel jugable es un 8 - 9, ¿ que me faltaría para ponerle un 10?

- Me faltan misiones secundarias para ampliar el mundo, era algo que se agradecía mucho en Arceus y simplemente no meterlas aquí me da la sensación que es por falta de tiempo.

- La captura, el sistema introducido en Arceus es inmejorable, me parece un paso atrás aunque esto parece ser más una decisión corporativa para separar las sagas.

- No se cómo será el post game así que no voy a criticar mucho por aquí, pero que quiten el frente batalla en algunos juegos siempre me parecera un error grave.

- Sigo sin aceptar que no esten TODOS los pokemon, no hay excusas. Es cuestión de echarle tiempo y Pokemon Company tiene los recursos.

Con esos 4 puntos el juego sería un 10 indiscutible a nivel jugable.

Vayamos con lo malo:

Por que pongo al juego un 6, porque está absolutamente roto.

Cuando juego Pokemon no busco un portento gráfico, ok, asumo que los gráficos van a ser malos y no voy a juzgar ese aspecto, me gustaría que fuesen mejores, pero no me resta a la experiencia.
(A esto hay que decir que le salva un poco la paleta de colores y el estilo artístico que le han querido dar con lo poco que tenían.)

Pero por dios, ya que haces un juego que visualmente es horrible lo mínimo que se puede pedir es una fluidez mínima.

Por un lado están los bugs, que si bien es cierto que te sacan mucho de la experiencia de inmersión, no es algo que afecte mucho a nivel jugable. Al final si te quedas atascado siempre puedes usar el taxi volador por ejemplo. Lo que más me molesta a nivel visual son algunas montañas que son malditos triángulos horrendos, sombras que aparecen y desaparecen por todas partes y pokémon que entras en combate y cargan con polígonos super triangulares.

Pero hay dos cosas que me sacan de quicio a nivel jugable y que son intolerables:

- Los fps en algunas zonas, dios he llegado al líder del team star de hada (zona nevada) y el juego iba a pedales, cómo cuando tienes un móvil de más de 5 años y quieres abrir el whatsapp y te **** muchísimo. La misma sensación horrible, de verdad me estaba tirando de los pelos.

- Cuando entras en combate con un pokemon salvaje. Dios en el Arceus esto iba perfecto le tirabas al pokemon parpadeabas y ya estabas combatiendo. Aquí parece que se queda pensando unos segundos muy molestos, el pokemon salvaje **** tiempo en cargar. Me jode mucho el ritmo y no entiendo este paso atrás cuando en el Arceus iba espectacular este apartado.

Mis conclusiones, si te gusta Pokemon este juego te va a encantar si o sí, el que te diga que es mal juego miente. Es un juego de pokemon divertidisimo de verdad me da mucha rabia no ponerle un 8 o 9, pero de verdad se ve lastrado por un rendimiento terrible y cómo seas una persona que se le atraganta ese tipo de rendimiento vas a querer tirar el juego a la basura."

If you look at a comparision you might even think that another developer team did the new game, since its just really blank in contrast to Arceus. The fluid transition from running in the open world to a battle we had in Pokemon Arceus is just gone, which takes the flow out of the game.

  ",8,"I have been a Pokemon fan since nearly day 1 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the games that give me the closest feeling to playing Pokemon Red for the first time in all of the right ways, but also in all the bad ways as well.

First the new Pokemon designs are great.  There are a lot of new Pokemon that I really enjoy and there's a lot of new favorites for me.  Palafin, Greavard, Scovillain, Revavroom, Baxcalibur, Nacli, Iron Thorns, Armarouge, Ceruledge, Tinkaton are all personal favorites of mine.  That being said, for a Pokemon that's based on time travel, it's kind of weird that we don't have new fossil Pokemon, nor a new version of Porygon, in fact Porygon isn't even in the game.  That being said, the selection of returning Pokemon is quite good and I think most people will find at least a few of their favorites have returned.

I do like the music and sounds.  The sound track is one of the best of any game on the Switch and the sounds all come out perfectly clear.  The environments are also generally quite nice, but we should probably mention the elephant in the room.  The performance of these games are not great.  There are FPS dips.  There are graphical glitches.  Pokemon is a game series that became popular due to glitches from the very start.  Things like Missingno in Red and Blue and the clone glitch in Gold and Silver are part of what made those games so easy to talk about and there are glitches like that here, like one that allows you to make your character run faster.  However, the overwhelming amount of glitches and performance issues in this game are bad and can be distracting at times.

As for exploring the world, I also have mixed feelings here.  If you are just exploring the world, looking for whatever as you wander around you'll have quite a bit of fun. There's LOTS of pokemon to see and catch and there's lots of other sights to see and things to do. It's just plain and simple fun.  The problem comes in if you are looking for a specific location to go to.  The map AI in this game is horrible.  When you first open it up, it sometimes rotates around until you realize there's a setting to turn that off.  They do not make it super clear that you can turn it off however and the button that shows you can could mean a lot of different things.  Even besides that though, the map still isn't good.  There's no way to toggle icons off, making it difficult to find the specific one you want to put a waypoint on it and it doesn't make it easy to figure out how to get from one location to the next.  Towns barely feel like they matter anyway with the open world being built the way it is.  Each town you'll beat the gym and possibly never care to visit again.

Speaking of gyms, the gym leaders and characters of this game are quite impressive.  I find all of them to be unique and interesting. The story is also very good.  I would say it's not quite as good as Black and White, but that's the games that it closest compares to.  Certainly better than most Pokemon games. Outside of world exploration, the story is probably the strongest part of the game.

There's also a new mechanic called the Terastal phenomenon. I think casual players will quite enjoy this and I generally found it fun but competitive pokemon battlers will probably hate it.  Raiding is also quite fun and the random raid battles is one of the best new quality of life features.  Speaking of quality of life features, I'm a big fan of the EXP ALL and I'm glad it's in the game, but it is disappointing that once again there's no option to turn it off.   It's always better to have more options and it's disappointing that again and again, this is something the Pokemon Company keeps getting wrong.  I'm a big fan of it, but I do understand why some people don't like it and this is something that needs to be fixed.

Character customization is also not great here.  It's weird that they chose to advertise that everyone could wear anything but then take out most of the clothing options.  In fact, there's also a bunch of other small issues.  The beginning is tedious due to the handholding and due to the lack of transversal options at the start.  Given how huge of a factor that is to this game, it probably shouldn't even be something you have to unlock.  Lacking signs on certain buildings is also an issue as you have to keep going inside to figure out what each building is.  The difficulty is also kind of weird.  Boss battles are too easy at times but catching Pokemon is too difficult.  It shouldn't take 10-15 ultra balls to catch a level 30 or so Pokemon.

All that being said, once you really get playing, this is a VERY fun game.  You should not let the performance issues get in the way of your enjoyment of this game and there's so much to enjoy.  The open world is very fun to explore and this is what I think most people want Pokemon to be. If you've been waiting for the big Breath of the Wild moment for Pokemon, simply put, this is indeed it"

- Low FPS
- Spiel bleibt manchmal für 1-5 Sek hängen
- FPS Drops/Stutter
- mehrere Abstürze (vermutlich DER Grund, weshalb das Spiel ständig automatisch speichert)
- der letzte Bereich kommt aus der Hölle. Leer, trist und PS2 Niveau, falls überhaupt
- Glitches, vor allem im letzten Bereich.
- Clipping Fehler
- und noch soviel mehr

Man kann mit Freunden spielen, wenn dann nicht...
- es gibt keine Freundesliste
- Man setzt auf ein Passwortbasiertes System, aber
- man kann nicht einfach einer Session joinen. Man muss unbedingt bei einem Pokecenter sein und wird im Anschluss dann ""irgendwohin"" geportet
- Ist mal die Verbindung weg (weil z.B. Pause gemacht, Absturz), dann kann man NICHT mehr in die alte Session rein. Diese muss abgebrochen werden und ... siehe oben.

Geschichte
- Neutral: Weder gut noch schlecht. Wie man es von Poki halt kennt

Terakristallisierung
- Neutral: da in weiten Teilen belanglos

Fazit:
2 von 10, weil die Musik ganz gut ist. Aber die Immersion (bzw. eher Spielspaß) leidet massiv am technischen Zustand des Spiels.

  ",0,"This is one of the worst-optimized games I think I have ever seen from a AAA developer.  By far the worst from Nintendo and far from the quality that one would expect from them compared to the rest of their supported catalog.  I have a hard time believing that if this was anything but Pokemon, it would have been allowed to launch in this state.  Simply unacceptable.  The laziness and greed of Game Freak and the Pokemon Company have gone too far.  Pokemon is the highest-grossing media franchise in the world.  If taking more time to create a proper game is not possible, then hiring more developers to ensure quality surely is.  There is no lack of funding, it is a lack of support and more than likely mismanagement by stuck-up old Japanese businessmen who refuse change and accept new ideas.  Anyone who accepts such a trash product from this massive of a company needs help."

That I enjoyed the game so much is definitely influenced by the fact that I do not care for graphics in the slightest as long as the mechanics and/or story are enjoyable. I can really unterstand why the lack of graphical quality, performance issues and bug would be of-putting to others, but I don't really care because I would rather play a good games with bugs than a well polished game that is just bad to begin with."

The actual world is a blast to explore, or would be if I wasn't able to see through the ground and hit more than 15 frames per second. There are a good amount great new Pokémon designs this generation, but there are quite a lot of bad ones as well. If you're going in completely blind to the game I can easily see you being disappointed in your starter Pokémon's final evolution. The character animations of the humans are awful, lifeless husks being puppeteered with view frames. The actual Pokémon's attack animations are somewhat improved. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet should have been delayed an extra year in order to fix the performance issues and the character animations. I can't recommend Scarlet and Violent until there is improvement to the performance so it becomes at least playable."

Yes, the fps do drop sometimes. And yes, the graphics aren't amazing. But I have played this game for 50 hours already, and I have encountered a total of 2 bugs. None of them were gamebreaking and they sorted themselves out in literally 5 seconds. If anything, I found them funny. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think the game SHOULDN'T have these issues, but trust me, it is not as bad as the Internet and the review bombing suggest. It's not even ANY close to unplayable.

The story is actually pretty interesting. The character design is top tier. The interior design of buildings is gorgeous. The world feels very alive. The gameplay loop is super fun. Pokémon variety is just perfect. The Terastal mechanic is actually a lot better than I expected it to be, I like it way more than Dynamax from the last games.

  ",1,"The potential is there but gets completely lost in glaring issues with performance, physics, bugs and outdated graphics. Also this game has a really weird obsession with sandwiches (there are legitimately more sandwiches in the game, than this generation has for new Pokemon (excluding recycled Pokemon)).

This generations gimmick is surprisingly good and will most definitely bring another layer of depth to the competitive scene. But while competitive battles are automatically in set mode they removed the option for set mode from the game for yet unknown reasons.

The power creep is too big in my opinion and allows you to sweep nearly all gym battles with a single Pokemon even while being under leveled.
And in my opinion the most annoying mechanic, the friendship mechanic, giving you completely unfair critical hits, status heals or keeping you alive when your Pokemon should die is still in the game and can't get disabled...

During my 15 hour playtime so far the game crashed 4 times and I fell out of the map 2 times which never even happened once in any previous Pokemon game. Not to mention an obvious memory leak which as today still didn't get acknowledged as a bug (but E4 music being bugged got recognized). I contacted the Nintendo support and received as answer that they are not aware of any performance issues or bugs with the game ... which is alarming in my opinion, making me think that the performance and bugs will not get patched during the lifetime of this game.

While it may have been the first ""open world"" game for Gamefreak it is not the first 3D game and not once did they manage to deliver since their jump to 3D. As the biggest franchise in the world they should be able to get help from Nintendo or Monolith which developed really beautiful and well performing games for the Switch already.

It honestly felt like I was alpha testing the game instead of playing a 60€ AAA title. I don't know how the game got green lighted for release in this state and it feels like there was no QA at all. I honestly expected more from a 60€ AAA title.

The graphics are also horrendous, I've seen assets on the N64 that look better, which is absurd. Half of the npcs/pokemon run at 1 fps and look like a literal walking slideshow when they get more than 3ft away from you, and even some of them at the forefront of literal cutscenes have the same issue. Scarlet/Violet feels like a big downgrade from Arceus, but at least the gameplay in Arceus was smooth and it ran higher than 5fps. I wish GameFreak actually wanted to make great games instead of doing the BARE MINIMUM and just raking in all the cash they can from pokemon fans.

The Terastal feature is also very meh/cringe in my opinion and to save time I just avoid it since the game already runs in slow motion most of the time. Even when the game doesn't run slow, the combat and ALL other actions are unnecessarily slow and drawn out. Throwing out a pokemon to fight takes forever and it will flash in and out as it appears before finally starting the battle. The quick battle feature, which I do like, alleviates this somewhat but I typically enjoy the battles in most pokemon games so it **** that I can't even enjoy that this time around. In Arceus it seemed so much smoother when throwing out pokemon and pokeballs. Overall this game feels like they took Sword/Shield and made it into a really crappy sequel to save time and money. The pokemon animations are better than sword/shield at least, but it's really sad if that's one of the few positive things I can say about the game. Gonna try to enjoy the game but it just isn't anywhere near as good as it should be and I'm tired of that being the case so often with the pokemon series. Good luck and be wary of all the reviews giving this game 10/10, they are ABSOLUTELY out of their mind if they think it is even close to being that good. If they enjoy it and love the game that's totally fine, but everyone keeps trying to ignore all of these huge issues and that is why GameFreak doesn't have to care if their games are good or not. People keep saying it's getting unfairly review bombed, but in my opinion the poor reviews are completely merited. Currently it is sitting around a 2.9 user score which I think is a pretty fair rating honestly."

The new Pokemon designs are pretty cool and I really like Paldea as a region. Lastly, the three story paths are actually interesting, but these are the only positive things I can say about this game right now. I can imagine that this would be acceptable to people who only play games on switch, but for those of us who have played a modern benchmark title on any other platform, this is plainly unacceptable. The performance in both the cities and open world is horrible. Anything that is more than a meter or two away from the player moves like it's in a powerpoint presentation. The frame rate drops every ten or so seconds even when nothing is going on and the textures look like they were ripped straight out of the N64 era. I'm not playing any further until there's a performance patch, and I would urge anyone who has not bought this game yet to wait.

It's an absolute abysmally-optimized lag-fest that was CLEARLY not ready for release. Almost every motion in the game is laggy, stutters, or drops the frame-rate. Everything is choppy and buggy. The game moves at a literal crawl. Almost everything in the environment is un-textured and super ugly. On top of this, the series continues going in the direction of anti-fun, with a forced experience share for the whole party, not showing stat improvements on level-up, a massively long and hand-holding tutorial, and (this is just what I heard) is still linear in terms of levels. You can *go anywhere* but if you do you'll just get the snot beat out of you for going somewhere you're not a high enough level for yet. Clearly Pokemon is not yet ready for the transition to Open-World gaming, as it somehow breaks everything whilst also being incredibly boring. Not to mention it's 2022, this is the NINTH main title for the series, and there is STILL no voice acting. Just tons of boring text on screen and awkward NPC mouth movements with no noise coming out. Now, before you think this is nothing but a hate-fest, I will say this: There are several improvements I can see they have made that I like. They are trying some new things out and some of the changes actually look interesting. That being said, those nice changes are pointless when made in such a terrible game as this. As someone who has ALWAYS bought a new Pokemon game on release, I now have to sadly say that I simply cannot do that anymore. What a waste of $60. It's insane how awfully this franchise is treated by its creators when its one of the most popular franchises worldwide. If you're on the fence, or just curious about it, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

  ",3,"I'm going to be reviewing this game mostly from the perspective of a competitive player.
This game was extremely ambitious, but unfortunately GF fell short in many ways. It definitely isn't all bad, but the bad outweighs the good.

Let's start with the good.:

+ Terastal mechanic overall seems really cool for competitive play, though it does reward more offensive playstyles. Unfortunately, the mechanic as a whole doesn't impact the story mode much, as you can only use it once per Pokemon Center visit.
+ Raid battles are MUCH faster than in Sword/Shield. This is huge, as the Dynamax raid battles sometimes took forever.
+ Autobattling is a fantastic feature and a huge time saver, though sometimes the Pokemon bug out and stop moving. The targeting function doesn't always work, either.
+ Items used for EV training and perfecting IVs and natures are VERY easy to get; you can buy them all for pokedollars. This also goes for all held items.
+ TM crafting strikes the perfect balance between TMs and TRs from last generation.

Now, the bad:

- the battle timer in 1v1 online battles is beyond stupid. 20 minutes is NOT ENOUGH TIME for a 6v6 fight, partially because of the lag and poor animations. They need to do away with this or AT LEAST MAKE IT OPTIONAL or adjustable.
- REMOVAL OF KEY FEATURES. Specifically, the Set Mode option and the endgame Battle Tower. I used these two on every single Pokemon game I've played. Set Mode specifically has been in the game since the originals, and the Battle Tower since Emerald. WHY remove them?!
- Trainer battles are way too slow paced. It feels like Diamond/Pearl. I'm not sure if this is just because the game runs at 15fps or so at all times, but the battles should be twice as fast.
- Too much text, both in battles and in the story. Most of the battle text can be shortened or compounded into fewer text boxes, but for some reason they refuse.
- Insane power creep from the offensive side. Flutter Mane is already showing itself to be Uber-tier with no real way to check it. The defensive nerfs really don't help either (though I do like some of the nerfs, like the Scald and Knock Off nerfs). I'm hoping the meta doesn't end up being hyper offensive with no way to check threats.
- This one's obvious, but the game has tons of technical issues. I've gotten stuck many times just trying to ride my mount around. The game is actually pretty good at un-stucking you though.
- Graphics overall look pretty bad. Most things not in your immediate vicinity are a slideshow or look like they're N64 era. I won't go too into this because most of the other reviews talk more in detail about it.
- Online play ****. This comes as no surprise to anyone who's played a Pokemon game, but I get constant disconnects and weird errors when trying to do raids.
- Lack of real end game. This goes right along with the removal of the battle tower, but it's still worth noting. I wish there was more to do other than raids and fight some level 60 trainers over and over again.
- Lack of options for online multiplayer battles. We should have more customizable rulesets for online fights. I really wish GF wasn't so tone deaf and would make it easier to play 6v6 with custom rules with randos. Friend codes are way too much of a pain.
- The music is lame. I thought Sword and Shield had mediocre soundtracks, but some of the tracks in this game are just cringy. The Terastal music has to be by far the worst one. What's with the singing?

Honestly, I'd recommend against buying the game unless you're an absolutely massive fan of the series. Competitive players are better off just playing Showdown and casual players will be turned off by the numerous bugs and graphical embarrassments."

  ",2,"I'm gonna edit my review here shortly:
Nintendo America started to give out refunds for the game.
Let that sink in. NINTENDO(!) starts to accept refunds for a POKEMON(!) game.
If you don't know how huge this is and how big the insinuations here are, you obviously don't know Nintendo very well.
Well, back to my original review:

I won't get into the issues with this game here, due to 1278 other negative reviews already pointing out the obvious stuff, and I agree with everything.
I will just say briefly, this game is a technical mess, but even the game itself is terrible.
A dead Open World with no actual life in it. No real improvements in terms of gameplay (the same battle system as Gen 1-8, but now even SLOWER.)
And a really weird difficulty balancing. There is no level scaling in this game, almost like they either didn't have time to put that in or this game originally was not supposed to be as open as it is now.
The game feels like they took an actual normal linear Pokemon game, but chucked it apart and threw it around in a bland boring Open World.

But one thing I really want to address:
To anyone who claims this game is the best Pokemon game ever made:
Please...stop insulting the 2D Pokemon games.
Even really old games like Pokemon Crystal are way better than this. Especially if you judge the games based on the timeframe of their release.
For a GB Game, Pokemon Crystal is awesome.
For a Switch Game, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet is a disgrace.
And if we include the timeframe both of these games released in, every single Pokemon game is better. Yes, even Sword/Shield due to being a more polished and working experience.

And no. The Switch hardware is not at fault here. We have seen how the Switch can handle games with Xenoblade 1-3 or even something less impressive, but still better than Pokemon...Breath of the Wild.

And to anyone who actually claims this is one of the best games ever made...
Please...play a good game for once...something made by people who respect your time and money.
Claiming Scarlet/Violet is one of the best games ever made is honestly an insult to actually good games.
For example: The Digimon series is made by people who have a clear passion for Digimon. How is it that these games have maybe 1/100 of the budget Pokemon could have, but pump out far more polished experiences?
It's simple. The Digimon Devs take their time to actually finish their product. They don't spam new games every new year.
This is the problem with Pokemon and why these games keep on getting worse.
Why is it that Zelda Breath of the Wild gets a sequel roughly 6 years after it's original release, but Pokemon just keeps on spamming games as hard as they can?
Why can't we get a polished experience LIKE Breath of the Wild for once.
Well, the reasons for ,,why"" are all there. You just have to open your eyes. Stop defending Gamefreak.
Or more likely...Stop defending the Pokemon Company in general.
Support games made by people who actually respect their playerbase instead of bullying it with 60$/€ Shovelware games.

,,Hey, let's spend 60$/€ on a game made by people who spit in the faces of their playerbase.
What? It's a fun game.""
This topic shouldn't be about if the game is fun or not.
This whole topic should be about if the Pokemon Company actually deserves your money for spitting in your face.
Please...everyone who gave this game a 6 or above. Have some selfrespect for yourself. Don't let big companies spit on you. Don't just accept that blindly ,,because it's fun""."

The story, like every pokemon game after black/white 2, is uninspired and weak. Battling is fine, but the fixed camera is a step down from arceus. A lack of character desgn is disappointing and the school setting adds nothing to the story. The biggest dealbreaker is the constant gameplay glitches, graphical errors, and worst of all the terrible frame drops. The graphics are also just sad, crazy how this multibillion dollar franchise looks worse than games that cameout on the switch in 2017.

Open world yes, but the same as always: raids and simple captures.  Nothing more.  Empty of life, with cardboard houses that cannot be entered and extremely easy.  BORING except for PvP, as always. - I will keep waiting for the ultimate pokemon: A NARUTO Shippuuden-like ACTION rpg pokemon, with the captures and use of the environment of Monster Hunter WORLD, exploration of ZELDA Breath of the wild, elaborate and varied quests like WITCHER 3, with many things to do like NI NO KUNI 2, which is like 3 games in 1 and enough personality to make it unique and not look like any of them...
- With an offline story mode that is challenging, fun.  With fights of x= vs x= (so you don't take your 6 and the rival 2...) - Unevolved Pokemon that were competitive or a PvP mode for them. - Attacks that increase according to use and improve visually as well as statistics and all useful attacks. - That the size of the pokemon is reflected, just like the shinys. - World and living environment where it is difficult to see pokemons near cities, that there are not so many and to capture them you have to study routes, put baits.  For this the map would have to be much larger. - 2nd and 3rd evolution difficult to see and catch. - Legendaries almost impossible to see and capture. - Taking out the pokedex to analyze one is necessary to register it in case you don't catch it, and it gives you VOICE advice about its habitat, how to capture it, stronger attacks... - They could focus on configuring something like this if they reduce the number of Pokémon to 300. Starting with the first 2 generations (maximum) each with its map (Kanto/jotho), without mixing them.  And they can expand it in the future with more generations and new things that they bring, being able to transfer pokemons from the first game. - Varied activities or professions with modes or online tournaments (not everything has to be combat...): Photography, races, selling recipes (farm game type) with unique ingredients that are difficult to find... Give him some life... - So that a game is not the same as another, the appearance of objects, pokemon, ingredients and others should be random (within areas that make sense).  Rogue-like type. - Since we are in VR.  It would be like being in the anime... - When I played pokemon blue, yellow and gold and watched the series in its early years, this is what I imagined and wished pokemon would be one day.  The only stagnant saga in the industry unfortunately. Will we see it one dayday?"

The coding, my god. It is, besides the bug type pokémon, riddled with endless amounts of bugs. Battle system glitches, lighting engine bugs, texture bugs, camera bugs. The performance is so bad, walking around the overworld feels like the air is made up of glue. Framerates will drop hard. Loading times are way too long even in battles between moves.

Still no battle animations like in the N64 Colosseum era.

There is no real level scaling and with the open world + raids formula you can become overpowered in a couple of hours making the rest of the games story events trivial.

People thought SwSh was the worst 3D attempt, but Game Freak delivered and proved them wrong, this is the worst.

Even for switch, come on Breath of the Wild has a debut game for Switch and if that game was a 10, this pokemon game is a 2.
The gameplay loop is ok, ""quick battle system"", battle some trainers, gym's, a lot of pokemons to catch in the open world, but instead of improving the franchise they are throwing it in the trash.
I grew up playing this game and I'm almost 30, I DON'T WANT TO DO PICNICS, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL,I don't want photo mode (specially is this crappy texture and polished game), I don't care about the gym's leader silly story, I don't want to do weirdo melon fall guys style crop challenge, I don't want to have a friendly rival (wtf?). I want a challenge, I want to be the Champion, I want to build a strong team and the game isn't about that anymore. I know that is been a while since the franchise is getting easier, but the problem here, is that the focus of this game is not the Pokemon anymore... is the silliness of this poor and bad designed open world.
The game is silly and has no identity anymore. I just don't get it, Gamefreak conquered the world with a working formula -> Monster Taming RPG is fun, and now they are changing the franchise to a dumb kid social game. Let me tell you one thing Gamefreak , my 10 years old sister plays **** with their whole class and no one care about your pokemon game. Actually **** community makes better pokemon games than you do. Your audience has aged! And maybe I won't even bother buying this game for my kids... I rather give him a gameboy so they could play Emerald.
The game is not fun anymore, the pokemon design is poor as so is the world, the texture and the direction of this game.
The performance issues are serious, low fps, weird glitches and etc, but to be honest, if the game was really good, no one would care about those. Elden Ring has performance issues and is one of the greatest game of all time.
The open world concept is poor and it doesn't match the genre, pokemon games always had difficult spikes and a simple and good enough story to go through, do you remember that felling that you HAD to beat Misty's Starmie to go on on your adventure?? That was cool, man, give me that back!!! Now they throw all of that way with a dummy school theme and super poor open world experience.
The most important piece in a open world, is the WORLD, isn't the 'open', this game world has nothing, I'm sorry is a bunch of grass, or sand, or ice. I mean GTA open world has people, cars, building, stores, quests all over the place. This pokemon game has nothing, the cities are simples, buildings have no interior, the open world is empty, is bunch of pokemons spread out over nothing, a few trainers here and there, some itens are spread over the world, but you know, there is nothing to do there... all the thing are centered in the cities/hubs.

If you get any open world game, you will see a lol of thing to do and interact with, this game has nothing, even on the NPC side.... there is no point on chatting with anyone in this game... no side quest, no collectables, no unlockables... instead of builiding the world aroung the game objectives, it seem like they just build the world and spread the 18 objectives you have on this game over that empty world. 18 .... this is usually less than the amount of 1 kind of side quest you have to take on normal games... this whole open world games has : 8 gyms (+ elite four as usual) , 5 titans, 5 stat hideouts .... and you are done. I mean... pokemon is a biggest game franchise, with almost 30 years of success and this is the game release of 2022 ..."

GameFreak, stop being stubborn and ask Monolith to show you how it's done.

GameFreak has been relying on Pokemon's success to handwave their own issues. You only need to look at Little Town Hero to know just how far the Pokemon name is carrying them through their own dare I say incompetence. As it is, despite this being their fourth switch game, they are still going at game development as if they were on the 3DS. And there is no excusing that. Stubbornly refusing to change their model, to expand from the small familial studio, refusing to try and learn how 3D development is supposed to work and refusing to ask help from people that know what they're doing is killing Pokemon.

La nota que tiene actualmente por parte de los usuarios es completamente injusta y sobredimensionada, un ensañamiento sin sentido ni lógica. al igual que pasó en su dia con E/E, obviamente no es un juego de 10 (pues ningun Pokémon realmente lo es), pero una nota más sincera y objetiva que se acercaria a su realidad es 6, 7, u 8 si realmente te gusta.
El asunto de los bugs en un típico caso de histeria colectiva causaba por el nitpicking percibido en las redes, porque cuando uno juega, esa cantidad de bugs que uno piensa que le van a suceder, no suceden, sino una cantidad muy baja de estos.

Lo que si no tiene objeciones son los problemas de rendimiento, y es que los FPS realmente se **** en según que cosas, pero no considero que sea un justificativo de bombardear el 70% de la calificación con 0's absolutos, eso no es razonable.

Let's begin, First and foremost the sever frame stuttering and frame drops persist through the entirety of the game. It never goes away it never gets better. The game can choke up loading assets and actually crash. Both me and my friend i have been playing alongside have had this exact issue happen. Where he had it happen 3 times in a row in the same area to the point he cant even enter the area so he just flat out avoids that whole section of the game. Menus are incredibly slow to the point it can feel as if it froze sometimes. The MASSIVE amount of visual bugs and technical bugs like falling through the floor or Pokemon walking through trees and npc's walking through battles inside the city areas. Lets talk about game design next. The game feels absolutely barren. How could you take a step backwards after arceus textures got worse than sword and shield for crying out loud. There are parts of the game that genuinely look like N64 level graphics on top of every area just feeling so bland and generic. Everything visual in the game feels like it was rushed out the door so they could work on the next thing to make them money. And its a shame because this game has plenty of good things going for it. Like the story is actually decent, the open world battling and seeing which pokemon are around to battle is cool. The new raids are cool with improvements since sword and shield.

Overall i cant give this game even  a 1 for score. Its so technically bad and choppy that it feels like it was an unfinished mess coming out from the studio. Lets just say Cyberpunk 2.0. Except we all know gamefreaks wont touch or patch the game whatsoever."

YEA! But what we have now is nowhere near as bad as everyone is making it out to be! Even the professional gamers here on Metacritic have give these games quite a good score. Many of the people here giving these a bad score have played a few minutes up to 2 hours, read other bad comments or watched reviews on Youtube without playing the game. Play through the whole game and you’ll enjoy it even with some technical issues. It’s definitely a must buy and play!"

I'm tired of people trying to justify giving the game high scores due to the gameplay loop. The gameplay loop in Cyberpunk 2077 was decent too -- didn't stop the game from being dragged over the coals for being a broken, borderline unplayable, mess ****. Just like this one.

Desde PKM Sun and Moon no tenía tanto hype por un juego de PKM, y bien la espera valió mucho la pena pero a que precio? No se puede negar el bajo rendimiento, pero llevo 35 horas de juego y de momento no me han salido los famosos bugs que están en internet, que, casualmente son los mismo 3, el único bug que he visto es el de la pokeball que se queda en el aire cuando intentas capturar uno, pero nada que afecte el juego, mucho menos la partida, por tal motivo no me quejo de los bugs y el bajo rendimiento no hace que mi partida sea injugable, mucho menos los gráficos pues desde los trailers nos mostraron los gráficos del juego.

El juego lo estoy disfrutando como niño, si bien las cosas malas que tanto se hablan estuvieran bien (poping, rendimiento, sombras y bugs) el juego sin duda sería de 9.5, y la única razón por la que no le doy un 10 es por temas más importantes para mi dentro del juego que de lo que se queja la gente pues reitero, a mi no me han salido.

LO MALO: en PKM Sword me atyrebo a decir que tiene la mejor customisación de todos los juegos de PKM con la mejor ropa, peinados y más con los que se inluyen en el DLC, por desgracia esta horrible hacer tu personaje en Scarlet, peinados horribles y estás limitado a 4 malditos uniformes, desconozco si te puedes quitar el uniforme terminando el juego, pero de momento no se puede y es molesto pues en Sword puedo decir que el personaje que es un avatar de tí, pude hacer el avatar que se parece más a mi y aquí simplemente no siento esa conexión con el personaje, otro punto negativo es el mapa para ver la localización de un PKM, el nuevo menú es más tedioso, teníamos muchos avances en Arceus y aquí regresamos 2 pasos atrás, espero se corrija y se mejore para futuros juegos.

Urge que se tenga una junta con The Pokemon Company, Game Freak y Nintendo y que se quede en no sacar un juego por año pues las consecuencias aquí están, si el juego le hubieran dado 8 meses más, no dudo que el juego hubiera salido bien en cuanto al tema de rendimiento y bugs, aún así el juego es de los mejores, tiene tantas cosas que hacer, un grand OST, los temas de la ciudad de la líder de tipo eléctrico o de tipo agua son temas épicos, los PKM ya respetan sus tamaños, los personajes por fin tienen más carisma y son de tu agrado en general y los nuevos PKM puedo darles en general un 8 de 10 en diseños, las ciudades son increíbles y los lugares, una enorme diferencia con Arceus y sobre todo con Sword, puedo decir que Paldea es la mejor región de todas.

En conclusión, Pokémon da muchos pasos con grandes ideas, primer mundo abierto y mejoras, pero los problemas técnicos le están afectado mucho, tiene todo el dinero para contratar a la gente correcta y que corrigan esos errores que esperemos se puedan hacer en parches."

Bugs, glitches, broken animations, low res potato textures, rendering distance stupidly short, frame lagging on anmations that are a couple of steps away from us, random stutters and so on.
Gameplay wise? The game is insanely easy, a few steps back from Legends Arceus, weird and long pauses during actions that make the gameplay really sluggish, completely empty cities, cannot enter buildings to explore them and the few you can are shops that are either just a menù where you buy stuff, a stupid sandwich shop or a copy-pasted barber shope directly from Sword & Shield (I'm not joking, go look at a barber shop there and compare it with the ones in these games).
Choice of paths is just an illusion: gym leaders and Pokémon do not scale with your level and you still need badges to make sure your Pokémons don't disobey you, exploration in the ""open world"" is boring, empty and ugly, dialogues with NPCs are pointless, some of them have bubble texts over their head which, if there are two people talking next to one another, both text boxes clip making it hard and annoying to read, and some don't even have dialogues.
And I can go on and on.

  ",8,"Pokemon Violet was overall a fun and engrossing experience, despite some noticeable issues.  This review comes after beating the story and catching ~75% of the pokemon in the game, which amounts to the vast majority that are available in just one of the 2 version.  The main pokemon I had left to catch were evolutions from past gens that I didn't feel like grinding out.  I think that based on this I have seen enough to give a fairly balanced apraisal.

First, the pros:
* The open world worked well and allowed a lot of freedom without ever feeling overwhelming.  There was always something new to do but it never fell into the trap of many open world games of overloading the player with options.  * The new pokemon were mostly all pretty good, though there weren't many stand out hits outside of the starters.  * The returning pokemon were very good choices and there were hardly any duds.  The fact that there were 400 across both games was exciting, and in general most of the new areas it was exciting to find out what pokemon you were going to run into.
* The tera system is interesting and should make for some exciting competetive games.  * Random battles are gone.  This may be a con for some, but it really makes filling in the pokedex much more fun and rewarding imo.
* There were some decently challenging battles.  Obviously this series isn't know for its difficulty, but I think in a nuzzlelock or perma death run this game might offer some interesting challenges.
* The graphics worked well.  They weren't the next step forward in realism, but they handle the scenes and pokemon well, and seeing the various emotions and movements of the pokemon is truly a joy.  It amazes me that they make so many different characters all have individual flairs and neat quirks.
* The world was fun to traverse, once you've unlocked some movement items.  This is a must for any open world game and largely works here, much better than I expected tbh.

The cons:
* Did have a few crashes, especially seemed to happen when walking into buildings.
* Performance was bad at times, but I dont think I had nearly as many issues as I hear reported.  Note that I played this docked on a first gen switch and it was smooth most of the time.  The main exceptions were some late game areas when a lot of things were on screen at once, and also in the water.  However, if you can live with the ocassional choppy frames, it wasn't really worse than virtually any other game I have played at release in recent memory, and the game is still playable with little issue.
* The story is not what you're here for, but still pretty aweful.  It is hard to write kids game stories that have real impact, but even compared to many of the other games in the series, this one is pretty bad. * The school idea was sort of neat, and it felt like they wanted relationship building like in persona, but that all fell pretty flat.
* The raid battles are pretty bad.  I didn't like these in sword and shield, and they aren't improved here.  Thankfully you can largely ignore these.
* The late game is a bit disapointing.  This is honestly probably my biggest issue with the game right now.  Obviously you can fill your pokedex and redo gyms, but there's just not much with any meat to it.  This is something that pokemon has struggled with a lot recently.   The high point of the series on this subject I would put at gold/silver, where you got essentially an entire extra pokemon quest to go on.  I'm not sure what the ultimate solution would be for this, but it would just be nice to have an adventure where you have a fully powerful team but still have lots of places left to explore with new pokemon in them.  Perhaps we will get something to fulfil this in dlc in a few months, but for now its pretty paltry.

So, there you have it. i would say that if you like pokemon games you will probably like this one.  It improves on the series in interesting and fun ways, but it is still a pokemon game at heart.  If you can overlook a few issues, some of which may be adjusted in the not too distant future, then there are many hours of fun to be had here."

There are better games and better JRPG out there, imo Shin Megami Tensei has become a better monster game than pokémon and has been since the 3DS era. Xenoblade is an excelent JRPG if you prefer a driving story game with gorgeous visuals and engaging combat. If you prefer the Pokémon formula you can try playing the romhacks made by the community but stop giving your money to an incompetent developers until they make a worthy game."

Bad graphics, yet bad performance. Many glitches, but no complex gameplay elements. Less and less content with no trade-offs. Pokémon Scarlet  joins bad with worse to make a quick penny from die hard fanatics who will defend anything with the right brand on them. Its not worth the money or your time."

This game looks and feels like a wet bucket of **** It's choppy, laggy at times, animations may or may not exist. I had the game crash a handful of times, laughted maniacally at people appearing inside of doorframes, fallen through the floor, and even seen it dissapear. But oh my lord beneath all of these seemingly awful issues is this wonderful game that I'm sure the devs weren't given enough time to flesh out and polish. For starters it's actually challenging, the game is functionally a boss rush with trainer fights all being optional aside from a few. The gyms, gang leaders, and titan fights are all excellent. The Pokémon designs are an overwhelming success to boot. So many quality of life features have been added. Overall a wonderful gameplay experience.

Honestly if you can get past the absolute rushed mess of a shell, the inside is a sweet treat that I highly recommend. Maybe wait for a few performance patches though."

  ",5,"Gameplay wise I think GameFreak have finally cracked the code when it comes to pokemon. The world is fun to explore, the battles are just as fun as they have been(albeit still a bit of a slog), the structure of the game makes it more replayable than any pokemon beforehand, and the ability to actively play online with friends elevates it into being one of the best pokemon games for a long **** least it would be if the game was finished.

I have never before played a game that is so clearly, utterly unfinished to the point of taking away from the experience as a whole. The graphics are...fine actually. Not amazing but ultimately inoffensive. The performance however is absolutely dreadful. Generally speaking I dont mind it when a game doesn't run great, especially on the switch, but this is inexcusable. Constant stuttering, frame drops, pop in, character animations become choppy the moment you walk 4 feet away from them, lighting errors, pokemon disappearing and reappearing, the list goes on and on. It is clear to me that Pokemon Scarlet/Violet were rushed out the door(likely by the Pokemon Company and Nintendo) in order to meet the holiday deadline.

It really **** because underneath that there is a legitimately phenomenal pokemon game here, but its so hard to look past the technical errors when they're a constant inconvenience. Im positive that in a few months the game will likely be looking and running a lot better, but in its current state I can't in good conscious recommend it to anyone unless you're a fan of the series or you really just wanna play with friends. Ill update my review when the game is finished."

  ",9,"There are plenty of people bashing these games for their performance and technical issues, but most of the reviews here are just blatantly unfair. While the games aren't quite as pretty as Breath of the Wild or Monster Hunter Rise, the visuals and performance aren't nearly as bad as people are making them out to be. Now let's move on to the actual gameplay.

These are by far the most engaging and in-depth Pokemon games since Black and White. There isn't a lot of hand-holding, and you are free to go where you choose after the tutorial, which only took me about an hour the first time around.

The world is quite big, with a huge variety of Pokemon early on. There are always a lot of different things to do. You can collect Pokemon, attend classes and do the school stuff, battle gyms, or chase down the titans or team star. You can also explore and battle trainers. The main story playthrough time is quite long compared to previous Pokemon games, and if you don't use any guides, there are definitely a lot of unique evolutions and challenges along the way that will be difficult to figure out.

I honestly feel kind of bad for all the people who can't look past some minor technical issues because they are missing out on a fantastic addition to the Pokemon franchise. Also, Game Freak has already acknowledged that many of the issues are due to a memory leak, so there will likely be a patch that fixes the issues very soon."

  ",6,"There a lot of issue with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet from a technical stand point, but the game itself is quite good. I can understand why there is a high amount of negative review because of that. But I'll try to look at it in a much more positive light even though the pokemon we can put into the game is only 400.

Gameplay 8/10: As always, the gameplay is still the same as always, but with the newest addition of Autobattle, this will make training my Pokemon much easier. The breeding mechanic has change into a Picnic gameplay, which is an interesting new addition. Then there the Teralization mechanic which seem like a poor man Mega Evolution, and Dynamax. Teralization does look nice, but I prefer Mega Evolution and Gigantimaxing anytime.

Music 8/10: The musical score isn't all that great, but it does have quite a good amount of music in the game where I can relax in. Then there the battle where it all upbeat which can get me in the mood for a good battle.

Story 9/10: The story would be the best in this Pokemon game. Not as great as 5th Generation Pokemon game, but this game does come close. We have three different path of which story we can take, and there also flash back scene and back story of important NPC. Gym Leader's story aren't as interesting as the Star Team though.

Graphic 3/10: Oh boy, this is probably one of the worse in this game and pretty much what everyone complaining about. I can see Gamefreak pushing themselves by making clothes and pokemon texture looking high resolution, but the environment took a serious hit. Of course, with a total of 1010 Pokemon with various forms, it no wonder they can only put in 400 Pokemon since they're trying to throw in some new high resolution texture on them.

Contents 3/10: Even though it a large open world game, I feel like it took a step backward. For example, our clothing line is limited to 4 uniforms, and all we can customize are hats, socks, shoes, back pack, and glove. They did increase our face like eyes and mouth, and hair style are now accessible to both gender. But I still like to customize my pant and top which is something Sword and Shield did great in. Then there the pokemon themselves, as what Gamefreak promises back then, we will be limited by which pokemon we can obtain in the game, so we won't be able to have a 1010 Pokemon roster including all it form. So for now, we can only obtain 400 pokemon until Gamefreak decide to patch the game to expand our roster. So if you have a favorite Pokemon you wanting to bring to Scarlet and Violet, good luck. Because over half of them are currently MIA.

Difficulty 8/10: This is quite surprising since Pokemon was always known to be easy. Since BDSP and Legend of Arceus, the Pokemon Company seem to be ramping up the difficulty for us which is a nice step forward. In fact, I sometime wish I would have more trainer battle than dealing with wild pokemon since wild pokemon tend to be a bit more dangerous since they can swarm me if I'm under level.

Overall: I think the game is good from a gameplay standpoint, but from a technical stand point and content wise, I think it took a step backward. People need to remember that this is an open world game, and like any open world game, it will be riddle with glitches and bad texture. It is also said that there a memory leak, and can only be resolve by exiting the game and re-entering the game again. Of course, graphical stuff wouldn't bother me as much if we only have access to 1010 pokemon which include mega evolution and gigantimaxing and I would simply be happy. I love Pokemon, I been playing them since 1998 when it came out into the United States. The biggest sin from Gamefreak are mostly the cut Pokemon Roster which we no longer have access to. If the Pokemon company only let us have access to all the pokemon, mega, and gigantimax. I would give it a much higher score. In fact, I would want to give it a much lower score because of our current 400 roster. But it okay, I'm an adult. I can get over the fact that they cut the pokemon roster. I am totally not salty at all. Not salty....."

    Nov 21, 2022
  ",4,"It's almost amazing, which makes it terrible. Let me elaborate:

The Good:
- Open world is a nice idea, and it was really fun to explore and have the freedom to choose the order of gyms and paths. I ended up doing it slightly out of order and the challenge was very rewarding.
- The characters (other kids) had pretty compelling arcs for the most part, and I actually liked them more than other recent rivals / characters. The final part of the story wraps up all the 3 individual paths nicely and it felt like you were living out a pokemon movie.
- The pokemon models are to scale and more detailed, and I loved seeing them in the open world just vibing.

Now, the Bad (there's a lot):
- The textures, visuals are... atrocious. Not just for a game coming out in 2022, but for a game that exists after the year 2010. I don't know if they aren't loading or if that's geniunely what it looks like but it's distractingly bad. I'm not a stickler for fancy nice pretty graphics- plenty of my favorite games have serviceable looks. But many of the features you see in the world unironically look like the in games like GTA 5 where the map glitches out and buildings only render as muddy polygons- but in S/V, these are just the actual geometries and textures even up close. I would get it if this were an Alpha state of an Indie game on Steam, but this is pokemon.
- The performance is similarly awful. Maybe this will be patched, but for a fully released game this is not acceptable. We seem games like BOTW, which came out on the switch in 2017, not only looking much better but running much smoother than this game. It's clear that this just isn't optimized. Hell, even the BOTW on the WiiU runs better than this. This is just framerate, too. A lot of the character animations when you're not standing right next to them run at literally 5fps. Microsoft powerpoint speeds.
- Certain mechanics from Arceus didn't return, namely the catching one. I understand different teams from GameFreak worked on this but really missed that mechanic in this game, and would have probably enjoyed and gone out of my way to catch pokemon in this game.
- The open world feels empty and incomplete. For every somewhat memorable design in the world, there's something that breaks immersion. A lot of the 'routes' or paths feel interchangeable in this game aside from maybe the first couple, and aside from trainer battles, there isn't really any standout locations in the world. Contrast this with past games where areas not only had their own character in design but also the locations/dungeons you associated with them- Lavender Town's Pokemon Tower, the Pokemon Mansion on Cinnibar Island,  Sprout City's Sprout tower, the Abandoned Ship, the Old Chateau- just to name a few. It doesn't help that most towns have literally 0 building interiors besides their Gym. One of my favorite immersive parts of past games was getting region lore by talking to everyone in the town and seeing their homes.
- This is more subjective, but the school stuff didn't really do it for me. I skipped most classes because the few I did were really boring- but also because even more so than the other games the dialogue (even when text speed is fast) takes an eternity. Nearly every transition shot between dialogue fades out and it just pads out a ton of time. Also, it kinda cheapened the champion route for me, as SPOILER you don't become Champion, you become 'Champion Rank', which is a small but meaningful difference. You don't go on the journey to become the very best, you're just... very good? Get an A+ ? Which leads me to my next critique:
- The Elite Four / Champion. I actually liked the champion's design and the rooftop battle, but the events preceding and following it are less than ideal. Starting with the Elite Four: The Designs are really lame, and the personalities are similarly shallow. In the past, you can tell what kind of pokemon  an E4 member might be using as its incorporated into their design and room design. But, gone are both the distinct bold designs and the rooms. Yes, all E4 members are fought in a clean boring sterile padded cell. This detracts even more from them feeling like this amazing final feat. More so, one of the Elite Four members is literally just a Gym Leader who is just being forced to also be an E4 member, and straight says something along the lines of 'Yeah I like my Gym type but I **** hate my E4 type but I gotta ig.' And then, after defeating the champion, no longer do you go into the a seperate room where you save your team and commemorate your accomplishment, its just a pat on the back. I mean... yeah it really is a downer.

IN CONCLUSION:
For everything nice S/V does with its open world and story ideas, it's undermined by its buggy technical performance, overall **** visuals, shallow settings, and extremely unrealized and boring school setting. Extremely disappointing."

El juego está plagado de bugs de todo tipo, desde visuales hasta técnicos, todos apareciendo con muchísima frecuencia. Además la tasa de fotogramas por segundo es bajísima, a menudo bajando de los 15fps, y con muchos objetos y personajes de fondo moviéndose a tasas inferiores de los 5fps, incluso a veces aún estando justo al lado. A todo esto se le han de añadir múltiples errores y fallos de todo tipo; desde errores repentinos que cerrarán el juego (haciéndote perder el progreso no guardado), errores de iluminación donde prácticmente toda la pantalla aparecerá de color blanco, cegándote por completo, pasando por el que se pueda duplicar la velocidad de movimiento al conectar un segundo mando, hasta múltiples 'clipeos' por todos lados, problemas repentinos en los modelos y animación de los personajes... Y un largo etcétera que no voy a continuar, ya que solo hace falta iniciar el juego y jugar durante un rato para descubrir un puñado de errores más.


Game Freak (o The Pokémon Company, quien esté al cargo de dar las órdenes) debe invertir mucho más en sus juegos, tanto dinero como tiempo, no es posible que una compañía con tanto patrimonio saque sus juegos en un estado tan deplorable, digno de un videojuego en sus primeras etapas de desarrollo.


Como fan de Pokémon, y como ciudadano, espero que las asociaciones de consumidores y normativas europeas tomen cartas en el asunto y logren sancionar a The Pokémon Company por la pésima calidad técnica del título. En este estado es una estafa sin precedentes para todo comprador y una vergüenza para toda la industria y para el legado de la franquicia."

Despite the game being very fun for those who aren't too demanding, it is overshadowed by flaws in the textures, frequent bugs, constant gameplay below 30 FPS, rendering errors and among other things, such as mechanics that were successful in previous games, such as capture of pokemon arceus and the interaction with the pokemons captured from Lets Go, make the game a disappointment for anyone looking for something new to play on the switch and who is not yet a fan of the franchise, a fan on the other hand, will play it precisely because it is fan and already accepts that this is how it will always be.

I'm not talking about the bad reviews in general, but you can tell a lot of them are just complaining because everyone is, or because Pokémon is the biggest media franchise in the world. But many forget that most of the money was made not from the games, but from merchandising. Merchandise accounts for more than three times as much of the revenue as the video games. The graphics aren't the prettiest of all the games, but I still think they're pretty good, even if there are muddy textures more often. The game's biggest problem in terms of graphics is that everything farther away is rendered, but everything close by looks pretty good for a Pokémon game. Compared to Legends Arceus, this is a step-up. Performance is more of a complaint. The FPS fluctuates almost all the time. The game really has problems maintaining the 30fps. Personally, though, this hasn't really bothered me so far. Except in the classroom, which was really sad. Because even though the students were all in the foreground, and you could see them well, they moved at 5 fps.

- Only 4 Outfits to choose from
- Not many customization options (Yes... a few more than Sword and Shield but still not enough)
- Graphical issues and glitches
- Terrible Lags
- FPS drops all over the place
- Creepy facial expressions (also in Multiplayer. Via Internet or LAN doesn't matter)

I was really hyped for the game before it released. I played it on day 1 with the day 1 Patch...
I was disappointed of the lacking customization options. Game Freak really took many steps back there. Using the same character model for female and male and can't even implement more clothing options. Uniforms? What the hell.... are you going to school in uniform? And don't tell me ""But it's a japanese game and they all wear uniforms at school"". Then why is everyone wearing uniforms outside of school in Scarlet and Violet??
I played it for 2 days now and today would be the 3rd day. I don't even want to play it anymore.
It feels like work. And a game should not feel like being work. It should be fun.

The only thing I really enjoyed was making sandwitches with my wife. Sad for a Pokemon game, right?
And I'm a hardcore Pokemon fan and got a copy of like almost every main series game.

People say Sword and Shield was bad? Oh boy.... Sword and Shield are amazing in comparison to Scarled and Violet.
BDSP? I would prefer that game over Scarlet and Violet! Game Freak should stop making Pokemon Games once and for all. They do not know how to develop games and are not willing to improve at all.

I bought physical copies of Scarlet and Violet. They are unplayable. Once the Nintendo eShop removes Nintendo Switch support I got 2 physical games that are unplayable and no way of patching them.

It is absolutely NO excuse to say the Nintendo Switch Hardware is limited. It is just POOR PROGRAMMING what makes these games so bad on the hardware. You can NOT blame the hardware on this! Compared to other games this is a mess.
Upgrading to better hardware is not the solution. It's just cash grab."

On the wild the Pokemon are mini, sometimes you will crash with them and you won't ever notice. In the boxes the images of the Pokemon are also mini. You will need a magnifying glass to identify what Pokemon it is. Really, they are too mini. This game looks like an aplha of a pre-released game.

  ",9,"After seeing the first trailer at the beginning of the year I decided to not look at any more info, trailers or gameplay and I managed; I went into the game completely blind. I wasn't even fully sure if it's really open world but it is and it is amazing. Especially the landscapes at the beginning look beautiful. So much that I kept thinking ""I can't believe this is really Pokémon"".
So far I put around 26 hours into the game, so I think I already got a pretty good idea of what is good and what not so much:

-the game stutters often times. It definitely has fps issues but considering this is Game Freak's first attempt at a full open world game and also considering that this is running on the Switch, which now uses over five year old hardware, I think that was pretty much to be expected. I'd fully get if people consider this a huge issue, but as someone who has never been used to 60+ fps in games, I can accept it.

-anti aliasing. I don't know if the game has any. This is especially noticable in towns (on buildings). Again, this might be due to GF not yet knowing how to opimize properly + the Switch' old hardware. I don't really notice it much in the wild though.

-lack of outfits. There are a LOT of gloves, shoes, hats, socks, backpacks, even phone cases BUT there are only four sets of shirt+pants combinations. And they are all school uniforms. I'm playing Scarlet, so I am ""stuck"" with orange pants... If we are already forced to wear a school uniform, I'd wish if we could at least change a little more about it... have differently colored jackets for example. Maybe also skirts.

-the camera. this is an issue I only found in wild battles where you can move the camera freely (in others the camera moves normally like in Sw/Sh). It seems it is focused on a point between the two battling Pokémon, which in theory sounds ok and for most of the game actually also works really well but... if you have a rather big Pokémon or one that is flying, you might not even be able to see it at all. I keep finding myself trying to adjust the camera to somehow get both Pokémon onto the screen, with mixed results. I think depending on the position/size of the battling Pokémon the camera should be zoomed out a bit. Or they should just let us zoom on our own (like how it's done in Xenoblade for example).

+open world. I'm not that much of a fan of open worlds anymore, but Pokémon is definitely the type of game where it seems like a good idea. Being able to just go anywhere, seeing towns in the distance... it's wonderful.

+buddies. we can let one of our Pokébuddies run around with us. They even pick up items for us. Definitely a feature I'd like to see in all future games!

+customization. We can change our clothes, hair, hair color, eye shape, eyebrows, mouth. The hair even uses physics and it looks really good. Again, I wish we'd have more top+pant combinations but I can imagine we might get Something more in the future per dlc.

+your own path. Once you are done with the beginning of the game, you are pretty much being told that you can now go and do whatever you want. It reminds me a bit of BOTW. The game does however give you three paths you can follow: you can challenge the gyms, help this guy to find special herbs (which is helpful and probably necessary if you want to explore the whole map) or help this one secret npc to crush Team Star. You can do the gyms and the other things in any order you want. So you have lots of freedom and can decide on your own how your journey is supposed to go.

+design. most of the region is very sunny, bright and colorful. This, the decorations you can see at different places, the town designs and even the music all have a distinct Spanish feel to them and it feels good.

+scale. actually being able to walk through properly scaled towns is incredible. Something I always wanted in a Pokémon game. With the first big town I thought ""no way we can walk through the whole town"" but man was I wrong. It's really huge. I remember my dissapointment in Sw/Sh' final town (the one with the Ferris Wheel)...

+sandwich propaganda. This game fuels my desire to make a really good sandwhich... You can buy LOTS of ingredients, make sandwhiches according to recipes or go freestyle. Different sandwiches give different buffs (like increasing your catch rate or the chance to encounter shinies)

Personally I'm enjoying the game a LOT, I can't stop playing. It's being pulled down mostly by technical limitations but if you can live with that and if you love Pokémon, I'm sure you'll love these games too.

I have more good things to say but I reached the character limit... :,D"

What should be an exciting new direction for the series and an overall decent Pokemon experience is completely brought down by the performance issues. The framerates, graphical quality, and overall stability of gameplay is all over the place from the moment you start the game. I tried to power through for a good dozen hours but the game legitimately strains my eyes and at times gives me feelings of motion sickness - in both docked and handheld mode.

I would be shocked if GameFreak did any post-launch patches to fix the litany of issues. Unless a lot of the technical issues can be ironed out, I really can't recommend getting this game."

Pero alfinal más que un juego de nueva generación parece un dlc pobre de pokemon arceus. Ya se ha visto que nintendo switch puede correr juegos de mundo abierto preciosos como zelda breath of the wild así que no hay excusa como la capacidad de falta de rendimiento de nintendo switch.

  ",5,"This is my first review, and fitting as its the first pokemon game i've played since Pokemon Emerald on the Gameboy Advance.

I want to start with what the game does positively because this game will get drowned out on the negatives so people who already knows it runs like ass can see what the game does well to see if its worth the purchase.

POSITIVES

This game actually has some really deep well thought out storylines about bullying, self identity and loss of loved ones. I really did not expect it to have stories like this as its basically a childrens game. I don't want to spoil the game, but it was a pleasant surprise.

As i haven't played a Pokemon game since Emerald, i'm unsure what quality of life features are new or old, but all pokemon getting exp from battles, getting more exp from new catches to incentivise you to catch new pokemon and being able to access boxes anywhere are really good.

NEGATIVES

What can i say? Gamefreak and by extension Nintendo, are honestly losing their flair and grip when it comes to one of their most influential franchises. The Nintendo Switch, continues to be the biggest blight in gaming history. It's outdated hardware forces console exclusives to be so behind the curve of modern gaming that they can do almost nothing spectacular or push any boundaries because it forces the game to have poor performance in doing so.

Pokemon Scarlet/Violet is no different. It runs awfully, doesn't matter if you're docked, handheld, new or old device. This game at times will run like a windows 94 PC. Can we really blame Gamefreak? Yes, yes we can. People will compare this game to breath of the wild, but honestly, breath of the wild is a far more empty world that looks pretty, whereas S/V is a way more populated and interesting world, but looks like its on PS1.

Combat is unbelievably slow, if you don't auto battle it feels like watching paint dry, but if you auto battle you get less exp so you end up taking forever to grind up pokemon.

The open world honestly was just a miss. It was an interesting attempt but making the open world essentially a circle where you can go left or right, means one side gets neglected and you're vastly over levelled when eventually travelling there. Also if you still keep the badge system where pokemon only listen to you based on how many badges you have, whats the point making it seem like the game has player freedom, as you'll have to tackle these gyms just to play the game.

The end game zone was a massive let down, without spoiling, the pokemon there are basically no different to anywhere else save for the 6 specific paradox pokemon for each version, it seems like they could have done a lot with that zone. But no minimap, no raids, no ability to even see the zone even post game on the map, just seems weird.

Why is your box legendary shiny locked? Do you really feel like people will leave so quickly that you need to put their shiny version in a future update forcing people who didn't know this to play a second playthrough to potentially get it?

Why yet again after the sword and shield debacle do you feel the need to keep half the pokemon missing from the game and say you're going to add them in a few months? why not just delay the game till they could all be in it?"

  ",8,"I’m going to be straight - this game does have technical hiccups. In my 20 or so hours of play, that has amounted to one Tera Raid freezing up, and literally nothing else that breaks the game in any way. At the forefront, the Pokémon battles, captures, and travelling in the wild have been free of issues besides frame rate drops when travelling.

The core gameplay loop has looked as I would expect it to, and is not different from what we’d all seen in the prerelease game footage. It’s been fun to track down Pokémon, and I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played on the story paths without complaint.

Do the choppy villager movements and background images like the windmills being choppy effect my gameplay? No. Are they visibly noticeable? Yes. I do hope they manage to patch out things like the frame rate and clipping through the environment, but it honestly hasn’t caused me to have any less fun."

  ",6,"I just finished the game and this is my little review from best to worse:

Story: 9/10
I liked how the plot was developed and how it ends. Characters were also amazing with a lot of personality. Best storytelling since Gen 5.

Soundtrack/OST 9/10
This is very subjective so I just going to say that I really liked it.

Open World & Design: 7/10
Real open world is such a big improvement from Arceus. Better interaction from pokemon in the different areas. Better design of environment. Pokemon design are good enough for me. It's a shame that gym leaders/dominants/bosses doesn't level up with you and this issue is very critical to me as a good/bad design to an RPG.

Mechanics & Difficulty: 6/10
Not much to say here. I just think tera did it better than dinamax but not that outstanding. Raids are better in this game. To be honest, difficulty I think it was just ok. But it's a shame some good mechanics from arceus were gone and there's no set mode.

Gameplay and Performance: 0/10
Sorry but all the good things this game did with everything above was destroyed by this. I mean, visual bugs, low fps rate, slow gameplay, data leak problem, bad models and textures, glitches everywhere... Everything about this is just horrible, this game needed another year... It's a big shame that this happens when we finally got a very good plot and cool innovations. Because, even with these things the game feels incomplete and unplayable for moments.

Final score: 6/10  Average"

The intro is particularly annoying and slow with the amount the NPCs stop you however even when the game opens up the gameplay feels annoying

The game series continues to remove old mechanics. You can't turn off battle animations so each subsequent battle feels slow. Set mode has also been removed as even an option

Navigating all the menus is worse than ever and the despite looking so empty the world map is actually really irritating to navigate as well with all the mountains and rivers. With the ""true open world"" you have no idea how strong a certain place is til you go in right up until you are in a battle.

The controls layout is also beyond irritating, lacks consistency and can't be changed. Why is B crouch while walking but jump while riding??

From the open world, co-op features, auto battles, Pokemon variety, QOL updates, party management and improvements, branching quests, and the traversal options. However, the same could be said about things the game struggles with. Bugs, poor instructions on player progression, lackluster story, disappointing clothing options, muddy graphics, the false sense of freedom, memory leaks, poor shop layouts, dexit, framrate issues, and a lack of world leveling.

This game was released with immense quality issues (terrible FPS, lack in quality of life, constant glitches, a pokeball sitting in middle of rooms and multiple cutscenes) that made the game unplayable in some regards. The company utilized the nostalgia and love for Pokemon, and released this game knowing full well that many would purchase it, knowing full well how terrible the quality was.

Like I said I enjoyed this game. I liked the character interactions and design, music, and overall open world options available (despite them being rather inflexible). However, it must be said that a transition to the open-world genre is no excuse for the quality of this title.

Pain comes from thinking what it could have been and what really is since the idea of implementing open world to this game could lead to an insanely good game given that you give it a decent level of production (wich is not the case). Coexisting with god of war ragnarok and two years after the last of us 2 goes to shows the abysmal difference between what a real triple A game can do and the actual performance of this game. Even in the same console breath of the wild and xenoblade 1 being old as **** give better performances with better graphics showing insane scenarios with crazy depth. With half the production level of gow it could have been goty and by far. Changing to an open world is an insanely good idea to be completely shadowed by a low level of production. In a non ironic way nexomon is better in terms of what they do with what they have and also in absolute terms. Your characters steps dont match the distance walked (if your steps are 1 meter long the character moves 1,1 meters aprox with each step) the amount of times that the screen goes blank to change from A to B is insane (made to save on animations), render distance is ridiculous, as long as camera shows high depth scenarios rotating it drains the fps like a vampire would do with your blood, if i talk about history i better just pull a gun and shoot myself in the balls, nonexistent dificulty with a system that almost forces you to overlevel as long as you step out of the main objectives and do something that is not walking, almost any shiny you want can reliably be caught in 40 minutes wich renders this game useless even for such a niche aspect. The only things that comes as good to my mind is that vgc tools are more accesible than ever wich is a trend that the series has with every game that releases since black and white 2 and music wich is always good but in this game being mediocre compared to sword and shield music. As always with this series since the last 6-7 years, this game is a complete deception. Even if a patch fixed all the nasty bugs and the fps performance that would still lead to a mediocre game with mediocre history and terribly mediocre graphics compared to games 10 years older. Just like modern warfare 3 was back in the day, a copy of the same ****ing game made to sell it to their braindead fans that buy the brand without any disregard for quality and to 5 years old kids. Just the chemically purest form of deception you could imagine

Tip: every once in a while close the game and open it again. Memory of switch is limited and doing so frees up space wich improves a lot fps and performance in general"

The constant slow down just absolutely kills the pacing for the game. And it’s not a rare occurrence, this **** happens literally in the tutorial. The gameplay and music, for what it is, is fine. But my worst encounter is all the glitches, and pisspoor animations. I mean, this is just absolutely disappointing to see. There’s way too many visual glitches, even on cutscenes that it makes me reconsider if this is the same franchise that’s worth over a hundred billion dollars. This could be a really decent game, if it was optimized right in the slightest. My warning is, if you own an earlier switch, DO NOT play this on handheld. It just doesn’t work. I am extremely disappointed in gamefreak. Sword and shield already set a new low, but this? This is just depressing. The Pokémon games need more time on the oven instead of being rushed.

You guys had one chance after you delivered a rushed-as-hell, mediocre Sword/Shield. You then actually delivered your first good pokégame on Switch in Legends: Arceus. But then you announced ANOTHER game for the SAME year - and of course you blew it again! This game SCREAMS ""should be released late 2023""!! A rushed, unfinished, buggy, slow mess with a thousand cut corners. There's a good, perhaps great game underneath, but it is by FAR the worst performing pokémon game ever released, it is rushed as hell, returns to many mistakes Legends: Arceus already repaired, has tons of cut corners just like Sword/Shield (slow as hell battles again, RIDICULOUSLY empty cities...)

It's just too much at this point, there honestly needs to be some kind of a revolution when it comes to these pokémon games.

  ",0,"The game does not perform well, and it is so upsetting that it detracts so much from the enjoyment of the game.

I think it’s because the poor performance is indicative that other issues with the game are also a result of time constraints on development. So whereas before, you could look at things you didn’t like & attribute them to questionable game design, now anything that isn’t right you know 100% for a fact it’s due to the game being so rushed. For example, no level scaling for an game where you “can” challenge gyms in any order, not an intentional design choice, just not enough time to get it right. No battle mode set option, never been absent before, not intentional, just rushed. No shop interiors, no homes to walk into, and only pop up Pokémon centers? Not minimalist game design, just no time to fully flesh the world out. No voice acting? Not because of tradition, just the most profitable franchise in the world refusing to spend a dime on making these games better.

This game truly sits at about a 6, but because of the fanboys giving it 10's telling you, ""if you ignore everything that is horrible about the game, it's actually good!"" I have to give it a 0. If you went to pull out your first stake from the ground, saw the black screen with text saying ""you pulled out the stake, and it vanished,"" rather than an animation of it actually happening, you can't give this a 10.

GameFreak has decided to set for themselves a new goal: releasing two games per year, as opposed to the previous practice of releasing a unique one (not counting remakes with minor changes) every two years, doubling the number of products while halving the time dedicated to production. All of this is clearly a problem if the level of the released game is this one.

Unsure if relevant for a review, but I would say that 60$ for an unfinished and rushed game of this level is not reasonable at all, specially if you compare it the other Nintendo titles released for the same, or lower, price (Breath of the Wild, Bayonetta, Xenoblade, etc)"

But this game surpasses everything. It feels like an alpha or beta at most.
In cities, the FPS rate drops from probably 24 to about 15. Shadows, people and Pokemon just pop up 5-10 meters in front of you. People move in 2 frames when you are 5 meters away from them.

I don't really care much about graphics and performance.

I've played games like Hyrule Warrios: Age of Calamity.
The performance of that game was also already very bad.
But I promise you, at this point Pokemon is even worse.

I expect a performance patch in the next 1-2 weeks, otherwise I'll send the game back.

Now let's talk about the game and the content:

I'm currently on the 2nd Pokemon arena if you run west. I would love to play more, but it's just not fun at all.
The cities are absolutely boring though.
Except for a few NPC's, nice design and probably ten stores that all sell the same thing, there is nothing exciting.

You can't enter normal houses, which you always could in Pokemon.

Clothing stores are divided into 5-6 different stores.
So I have to run all over town to buy a whole outfit. This feels like game time stretching.

I could probably make this review 3 times longer, but let that be enough for now.

Otherwise, the game seems to have potential. The Pokemon are cool, there seems to be a lot to do.
The world could maybe be a bit more interesting, but that's ok so far. However, the game is simply not playable with this framerate.

  ",1,"We are beta-testing a Pokémon open world for them.

Technical Issues:
- Performance is atrocious for a triple-AAA company releasing on a stable console OS. It feels like trying to run a PC game on low because you do not meet the recommend specs.

- NPCs move around like robots at 3 FPS like a slideshow, unless you are very close to them.

- Many times the camera clips underground and you can see the abyss below. This happens often in trainer battles that are on elevated ground.

- Character movement is so weird and clunky. You move like a robot too, snapping into a locked position when ascending/descending.

- Lighting and Shadows are as bad as it gets. Many times the time of day causes your character to look pitch black (even though you are white). Other times the lighting causes your character to look completely white like a ghost.  Most Shadows are a flickering mess or don't align at all.

Gameplay:
- The world is big but barren and depressing. There is no depth and detail to anything. The world is as big as the ocean but as deep as a puddle. The cities are entirely dead, the majority of the NPCs can’t be interacted with, and all the stores pop-up Trade UI menus to buy and sell. There are no store interiors any more. The lazy failures didn’t even design a simple clothing shop.

- Exploration feels good for the first one or two hours, but gets very repetitive very quickly.

- The game has three ""main"" storylines which can be completed in any order or all at the same time. Due to the nature of Pokemon games completing them one at a time is not recommended since they don't auto-scale to your party. So you either do them all at the same time and try to balance your team level to the encounters (which is not viewable unless you start the battles) or train up one team for each storyline or just pubstomp the second and third one.

- The new mechanic called ""Terastallizing"" is the worst out of all new gameplay mechanics introduced in the later generations. The type of your Pokémon may change and it will basically get the ability Adaptability on top.

Character:
- Character customization is terrible. There are only 4 outfits that are just ugly. Tights pants that are orange with stripes? Who thought of that? It’s like you are wearing clown pants. Every player looks the same now. There is zero diversity. Zero role playing value. The accessories you can change (gloves/hat/bag) are a few recolors that feel pointless since the main attire is disgusting. SwSh had the best clothing options, especially with the DLCs. You could role-play as anything. Not any more. You are stuck wearing clown-pants with suspenders throughout the game.

Pokémon:
- Some of the new Pokémon-Designs are outstanding, some are lackluster, overall pretty good.  Most new Pokémon resemble animals which is heavily dependent on ones preferences.

- New held-items and abilities are refreshing and propably good for the competitive scene, but only time will tell.

Verdict:
This is definitely an early alpha version of the game released to the public. People need to start getting fired at Game Freak because this garbage is not a video game. This is really sue-able; especially if they do not offer refunds."

  ",5,"Besides from all the bugs everyone knows about (which are inexcusable, especially for an AAA game), the game feels weirdly empty for something that's supposed to be open world? We're given three different 'plotlines' at the start of the game, but no idea on how basic features of the game work. I had to find out several features from forums and talking with friends. I don't need a tutorial for everything, I've been playing Pokemon since Fire Red, but knowing how to change your appearance or that there's a reward system for collecting certain amounts of Pokemon seems like something that should be told to you.

There's nothing to do in towns besides buy food that give you effects that you have to guess on what they do exactly and buy accessories for your outfit. NPC's don't say anything interesting and  there's no unique places to visit in the towns (like a fanclub or an academy) - I half expect to see tumbleweed blowing through the streets.

There are some bits I like - the raids, some of the newer Pokemon designs, the Pokedex design - but they're completely overshadowed by the game crashing every other time it's loaded, the awful lagging, the stripped features, the weird emphasis on other features that aren't super important (seriously, what is with all the sandwiches), the 'targeting system', the illusion of choice, and the fact your mount goes as fast as you do running (or maybe that's just the lag - I literally don't know).

Lesson learned, I guess. I think the only reason I'm giving it a 5 is because I'm (somehow) still hopeful I'll find something else to like about this game."

  ",3,"While the core gameplay is fun, and *some* innovation from Legends Arceus came through, the game is so fundamentally broken on a technical level that it is impossible to give anything above a 3/10.

So many features were cut from previous instalments that opens up questions regarding Game Freak's intentions; do they want players to enjoy themselves or feel frustrated?

As is with every mainline Pokemon game, there is a 1 step forward, 3 steps back rule. The over-world catching and combat is great, but there are no Shiny sound effects. The models are minuscule (the smallest of the Pokemon are neigh invisible which makes it incredibly frustrating). For some reason the Set/Switch option was taken out of the game. Still no sign of a quick-EV training minigame such as the ones from X/Y. So many quality of life features are missing, with little to nothing to show for it.

The over-world size is as expected of an open world game, but what isn't expected is the poor graphical fidelity of it, as well as nearly every other aspect of the game, besides the Pokemon themselves, which seem to have gotten model refreshes. The most striking ones are the metallic Pokemon, such as the Pawniard line, which have a shiny metallic finish which really gives it an extra oomph. The rest of the game looks like a poor Playstation 2 era port ****.

There are so many glitches, bugs and micro (as well as macro!) stutters. Overall, the game does not achieve 30 FPS at any given moment, at least not in my case. There is constant popping, light and shadows completely breaking and stuttering, clipping through terrain and objects, entire cities blacking out, deleting and then reappearing in the span of 3 seconds, horrible FPS drops and stutters whenever Pokemon spawn, or, lord forbid, you enter a city. Seriously, city proximity turns the game into a slideshow.

Over half of the Pokedex has once again been cut out of the base game and I have no doubts they will once again sell you bits and pieces of it through a paid DLC. Horrible practice, especially for a €60 first-party Nintendo game.

Game Freak needs major restructuring. Whether it's more development time, more staff, or a complete work environment overhaul; something needs to change. A $90 billion franchise cannot allow itself to treat their mainline games in this manner. Not only are there massive cuts in the content of each subsequent games, the games are releasing more broken than ever. The visuals aren't just outdated, they are antiquated. Either all of the issues need to be addressed, or Game Freak needs to stop charging €60 for broken, unfinished games. Charge it like every other developer releasing what is clearly an Early Access game, a nice and fair €20.

This is unacceptable, and Game Freak should feel nothing but shame for this product release."

I understand the Nintendo Switch is the worst new gen console when it comes to running games and hardware in general, but that doesn't excuse the fact at how bad this game runs. Averaging 20 fps, while dropping to 15 or even 10 when many things are loading, this is without a doubt the worst performing Pokémon game ever made.

Under the glitches and stuff, the design, the gameplay and the story is pretty damn good and a great change of pace and direction of the series. Maybe its more insulting and saddening that it actually showed a bit of a diamond in the rough compared to it being openingly bad.

HOWEVER....

The technical issues this game has is way too glaring to ignore. Issues include: Frequent and nauseating framerate drops in crowded areas and after exploring the open world area for long periods of time. Constant freezing between cutscenes and battle scenes. Missing sound effects, T posing characters and invisible pokemon. Camera clipping through environments and characters. Suspected memory leakage due to assests not deloading as expected (suspected as issues improved a a bit after restarting the game.)

Worse part is that the drops of framerate have made me feel sick often and same for the weird snapping camera. To the point of needing frequent breaks or to walk away from it for the day.

How did this go so wrong? Especially after how good Legends was earlier this year!?

THIS NEEDS FIXED! Patched? Something! Anything!

Although, the game does feel laggy at moments but it is something I can look past. Getting the performance side out of the way, the new Pokémon game goes all out in changing the way we play Pokémon. It feels like a big upgrade on Pokémon Legends: Arceus, mixing the good points from the game with the classic Pokémon formula. I tried to go into this game without my nostalgia goggles on and to the games credit, it did well to add new features and Pokémon without alienating me completely. I’m not a fan of most of the designs of the new Pokémon and luckily I could create a team that includes Pokémon specially from the first few generations. Honestly, I’m not the biggest fan of the new Terastallizing dynamic, BUT similar to other gimmicks like mega evolutions from X and Y, it’s not a crucial part of the game and if it really isn’t you’re cup of tea it can be ignored all together. Overall I do genuinely like this game, it’s one of the best looking Pokémon games we’ve ever had and remains one of Nintendos best franchises. For the way Pokémon seemed to be heading, especially after Arceus, I think this game is more a step in the right direction to keep the franchise feeling new, but with the same classic Pokémon charm."

That being said, unless you’re interested in competitive Pokémon, this game cannot be recommended unless they fix performance.

I specifically came to review this in response to the multitude of article referencing the issues with graphics, as I find the issue to be exceedingly superficial. One of my biggest hangups prior to buying the game was my hesitancy to engage in another gimmick mechanic that would throw me back in the heavily overpowered shielding of dynamax raids . Going in I was worried that Tera Taids would be both as long and agonizing to complete however upon entering my first one I was both surprised and excited to find out wrong I was. Game Freak has truly outdone themselves with and extensive story. Immersive and Fun gyms and battles as well as creating a story that makes you feel as though you as a Pokémon trainer have a personal stake in the fight. I will say one minor issue with the graphics is that at time Pokémon will simply spawn right in front of you seemingly after you’ve already walked into it, as well as the fact that the game crashed Three times over the course of playing the story. However, notably Pokemon Sword also had similar issues at launch with stability updates released throughout the lifespan of the game. At this time taking into account story, mechanics, exploration, and the expansive cast of characters, , I would say this game is absolutely worth the purchase price."

I would rate it a bit higher because of those nice things, they don't annoy me enough to not enjoy the ride, but the moment you notice they are a AAA franchise, they sell full price of an AAA, it looks worse than some indies and they don't really innovate that much as indies do... and give you this badly optimized game, which is even more criminal if you think that they literally developed it to work with Nintendo Switch, it's not a port like a third party.

Sadly, no. Removing Switch mode completely takes out the element of preparing for type advantages mid-battle because you will always take a direct and lethal hit from the advantage against your set Pokemon. I know the games were developed simultaneously, but I do wish that some PLA elements were carried over. I don't want PLA 2, but after playing it, I realized just how good some of the ideas presented would be for the series as a whole, for both presentation and gameplay. (EX: There is a glowing beam of light telling you where to go as a Pokemon sits idle, with you needing to run into it for a cutscene to play. (Compare this to PLA just displaying a small signal on your map, with the cutscene beginning automatically once you enter the area.) The animation for things like battles, Pokemon in the wild roaming around, and the ""Let's Go"" action all felt off. It was a fun idea to sneak up on wild Pokemon and doge attacks that could cause them to fight you, forcing you to flee if you didn't want to fight those Pokemon. EV and IV training being streamlined were all great additions. I don't want game-overs, a genre change, or crafting systems; I want a shakeup of the formula and better presentation. Scarlet and Violet show glimpses **** game before delivering more of Pokemon Sword and Shield with worse performance and glitches.

I love this franchise, and I sincerely hope that these reviews reach the Pokemon Company's ears and that what they take away from them is ""Give the developers time and hire help."" rather than ""Never try anything new again."" "

This game now not only have a disconected story with weak points all over the place, but has cut optimizations that even Sword and Shield had in ther time - and that is saying a lot.

A open-world filled with bland design, sacrified inside of houses and stores, and no character customization of clothes. The game doesn't even take your level in consideration of the route you take and all events before gym's makes no sense even for a Pokémon game. And sadly Terastalize are a waste of time just like Team Star. This game is a shame for the game industry as a whole."

  ",4,"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the worst running Pokemon games that have ever been released. There is horrendous pop-in, a low and inconsistent framerate, and has various hangups when doing just about anything, including entering menus or entering battle. On top of this, it somehow manages to look worse than any other Switch based Pokemon game, and even worse than Pokemon Colosseum, a game on the Gamecube from nearly 20 years ago.

The gameplay is acceptable in some places but takes several steps back in others. Customization is severely limited, and you are not able to change your clothes beyond 4 outfits. The Battle Tower and any post game facilities are gone, likely to be included in a future DLC, if at all. For some inexplicable reason set mode is gone and you are unable to change basic things such as skipping battle animations. You are advertised as being able to challenge the gyms in any order but this is very misleading, as there is no scaling on the gyms, so doing them out of order will mean you are going to either be too high of a level or too low, and never on par with the gyms.

If a future patch fixed all the bugs and performance then the games would still only be about a 6-7, just due to the removal of features."

  ",4,"This game is soulless. It simply feels unfinished. While playing this game the main question that pops into my mind is “…why?” They’ve just gone and removed things. They’ve removed the ability to go into houses and talk to NPC’s. This removes soul from the game as all towns are completely and utterly pointless. No more trades with random NPC’s or mini quests to deliver love letters from a ghost. Add in the fact clothes shops sell really dumb stuff like helmets so it’s not like you’re using those often. I’m not sure why they’ve added 1000 sandwich shops to towns. Making sandwiches isn’t even a fun mini game. At least you could make yucky poffins and soup in previous games. On to the next point, making my character stuck in a hideous school uniform with hideous hairstyles also removes soul from the game. Game freak apparently doesn’t want girls to be girly in anyway. No long hair or skirts. The Pokémon league is complete joke in this. They actually ask  “do you like Pokémon hurrr durr” before you’re allowed to battle the league. You do not feel like a champion after defeating them. This game also suffers from the over talking. Can they please just shut up when we’re battling. I’m not sure why Nemona is being praised for being a breath of fresh air. She’s the most annoying character in the game. The constant stopping me at gyms to say “yay! battling! I like battling” urgh. Can I have Silver as my rival again please. This game really would be 10x better with all the Pokémon. The open world is fun but there’s not enough in it to want to explore. As I said, towns are pointless so I don’t wanna explore those. There’s only 400 Pokémon so exploring the map to catch them doesn’t take too long. I also don’t know why people say “the stories sooo good” HOW. How is the story good? Titan Pokémon is interesting. Team star **** so much. I hate them. Nemona ****. The Pokémon league ****. The TINY BLOB of good story at the end of the game does not equal the best story pokemons had in ages. Game play is fun, shiny hunting is fun.. so 4/10. Game freak really dropped the ball on this one. Their team that made Legends Arceus should’ve been in charge of Scarlet and Violet as the drop on quality between these games is quite significant. Arceus didn’t feel soulless at all."

Now on to why I think it actually deserves a positive rating.
It's open world is well built in a way, it's interesting and really dig the Mechanic's they've implemented.
Making it easier to get rare spawns by doing x.
they've made it so you can skirt around and do as ya please. It's an astounding and a bit jarring how they've changed it.
The pokémon company really tried this time around to innovate and they've nailed it, this is my favorite pokémon so far.
I have to applaud them, it really feels fleshed out in some ways that I never expected. The traversal and going around is well thought out,
Removing the barrier so you can fly from the get-go was a good call. Giving you a ""bike"" at the start of the game helps. I have been playing it since midnight and I'm still just running around and catching Pokemon. Not even concerned about gym badges gating me off from exploring. Now I get the switch isn't the strongest and I'm usually 100% down for putting a switch port as pointless and it's going to end badly.
This enforced that feeling for me, the switch is just too weak for it, if it could be fleshed out, this games ambitious target would literally change everything.
I haven't liked pokémon since Ruby and Sapphire. I appreciate they split it up into three different paths and you can go back and forth between each of them anytime you want. I appreciate their hands off approach, I appreciate the multiplayer actually being good for once. Like you can outright join a friend's version of the game and catch their exclusive pokémons for their versions in them. HOW cool is that?! If they can iron out some of the glitches like shadows, texture popping and some traversal glitches. I don't think I would stop playing this game anytime soon, this is a game that I'm probably going to pour hundreds of hours into. It made me care enough to actually make a account for this useless/horrible website. I have to give it a 7, I want to give it a 9.

With their first attempt in a true open world game it also came problems and limitations, as you can now explore a wide open world but can no longer explore inside buildings, shops now are just a screen with goods and Pokémon centers became a gas station, the textures are once again very bland and although it looks better than Pokémon legends it's not much of a improvement, the animations are kind of a mix of good and bad, some attack animations got really cool like flamethrower and others like surf and earthquake got bland and boring, and let's just try and ignore the fact that a game made in 2022/2023 lacks any sort of voice acting, It's ridiculous to watch a game cinematic with the character in the screen screaming full lungs without a single sound being made...
It seems Nintendo are also trying to push the woke agenda among the Pokémon fans, being a game made for children make it really concerning, you can now barely differentiate your character gender as you can only choose 4 neutral and ugly outfits, most of the NPCs you find around the game are dressed with the same 4 uniforms, even when it's not the case the agenda remains strong with the rest of the NPCs outfits being bland and ugly most of the time. With almost 60 hours of gameplay, I found only 2 NPCs wearing a dress, one was an old lady and the other being a Gym leader whose happen to be a model.
If it's not enough here comes the most glaring issue, performance, the game struggles to keep its capped 30 fps and fails at it most of the time, depending on the zone you are and the density of Pokémon, trees and background the fps can drop to single digits or the game will simply crash, there are tons of minor visual glitches and missing textures once in a while and the Pokémon placement in the world looks uninspired and boring, just a cluster of Pokémon walking around doing nothing most of the time.
Even with all these problems, the core game is still there and as a long time Fan of the series I still hope that this game get better with future patches but as of now grading it with 6/10 is already being merciful."

  ",2,"I'll be honest, I really don't understand the current obsession with open world games, why does every game nowadays need to be open world? Kirby, Sonic and now Pokémon are all franchises have recently made the transition to open world and may have lost their identity in the process.

Anyway, the game... Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is the worst performing game I have played in a long long time. I can usually overlook poor performance if the game is immersive and entertaining. Games like Skyrim are a good example of this - full of bugs but enjoyable. Bugs are also not necessarily a bad thing, the first generation of Pokémon had bugs (e.g. Missingno) which didn't impact on performance and actually made the game more exciting in a way. The kind of bugs seen in this generation ruin any immersion of the game and made me lose interest in some of the battling, especially when the camera clips through the landscape.

The game is ugly, about 10 minutes in I realised this where I was looking at my rival of the game (Nemona) in the distance who was just a pixelated mess. in fact, avoid looking at anything in the distance in this game, the visuals are horrendous.

The framerate is garbage and is as bad as everyone is saying, going back to the last point, if you look at anything in the distance it is pretty much guaranteed to have a bad framerate. The windmill in the first town I visited was, no joke, rotating at 3 frames per second... the Tick Tock Clock level in Mario 64 managed similar with no issue. I've actually seen a graphics comparison to Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast - take a look, seriously.

One thing that has been improved is the Pokedex, collecting Pokemon is fun again! From starting my adventure I made it my mission to catch as many different types of Pokemon as I could. This however was slightly detrimental as since you gain EXP every time you catch a Pokémon, it made me over levelled for any trainers that I came across. This made the battles in the game the most boring in the whole series and I avoided most of them (which is now easy to do as trainers no longer approach you).

The game has been even easier. You can't choose the battle style to set anymore, EXP All is again mandatory, you can craft TMs at every Pokemon Centre instead of seeking them out. God knows how you'd even attempt a Nuzlocke to give the game a slight difficulty boost. With all the things the Gamefreak changed in the game is it too much to ask for some kind of hard mode.

I'm hoping these issues will be resolved, but to release a game in this state at full price is really scummy. They should be ashamed of themselves. Shigeru Miyamoto himself said “A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.” Why couldn't Gamefreak follow the same principles?"

Like for example, I like the concept of the three storylines, it gives you lots to do and I like how the mechanics around how you complete those three story lines is different and not always the usual turn based battle, but that is overshadowed by the fact that they said you could do it in any order but the levels don’t scale…. Then you can’t really do it in any order. Then, I liked that they added more customization for the face features and that hairs aren’t gender locked but all of that is overshadowed by the fact that we are stuck in our school uniforms. Sure they gave us different socks and backpacks and shoes but what is the point of any of it when all of it clashes with the ugly orange pants that I’m stuck wearing?? Where is the customization in that? It feels like an even bigger slap on the face because NPCs have other cool outfits and hairs on but we can’t use ANY of it??? Also, the Pokémon models are way too small. The Pokémon are arguably some of the best looking assets in the game but we can’t even SEE them bc they’re so tiny. Lastly, they advertised this big open world experience but the world is empty. They clearly made attempts to make it feel full by separating all the stores but that just made it even worse because now we have to go to a million different places just to get some ugly socks and hats and to add insult to injury, the stores are just rabbit holes?! Virtually none of the buildings in the worlds are accessible in any way and you can barely even talk to the townies now, so we don’t even get those cool tidbits of story or surprise items from them like in the old games. The world feels empty and lifeless, and not to mention UGLY. The textures are honestly laughable, a company with as much capital as gamfreak couldn’t at least find some seamless textures? You can literally see the squares of textures on the side of the cliffs, and it’s NOT a switch hardware issue, more intense games like no mans sky run just fine on switch, and have less frame rate drops than Pokémon does. Honestly gamefreak should be EMBARRASSED, the clearly released an unfinished game and they better release a BIG BIG Im sorry update with fixes, larger Pokémon models and added content, so we can actually customize the way they advertised"

1. El juego esta lleno de bugs y glitches que arruinan la experiencia dentro del juego no puedo disfrutar del juego por los fallos que tienen y el que diga que no tiene fallos es un mentiroso.

2. Tiene muchos bajones de fps hay ocasiones en las que te mueves a 10 fps incluso los npc tienen bajones de fps se mueven tan lento eso distrae y hasta da risa de ver eso por lo malo que es 3. Hay poca customatizacion para el personaje pasamos de tener mucha ropa y accesorios en entregas pasadas a solotener cuatro conjuntos de ropa y es ropa fea porque esos uniformes son horribles 4. Los diseños de muchos de los nuevos pokemon dejan mucho que desear solo miren las evoluciones finales de quaxly y de sprigatito son horribles y tampoco estoy diceindo que en entregas anteriores hubieran no hubieran diseños feos solo miren a geodude es una roca con brazos.

5. No estan disponibles todos los pokemon se supone que eliminaron muchos pokemon para hacer mejores animaciones pero eso fue mentira las animaciones estan horribles y los pokemon no hacen contacto entre si al momento de combatir.

6. Los diseños de los paisajes estan horribles que acaso los de gamefreak no salen del calabozo En el que estan encerrados porque esos paiasajes esatan horrobles y para nada emulan los de la vida real 7. Los diseños de los personajes estan horibles ya lo habian mencionado la cominidad japonesa que los nuevos personajes parecen salidos de la propaganda woke.

8. La historia esta meh no hay mucho de decir sobre ello ni tansiquiera se puede viajar al pasado siendo esto una tematica dentro del juego 9. Hay muchos lugares a los cuales no se puede acceder como casas que no se pueden entrar es mas las tiendas no tienen modelados sus interiores cuando vas a una tiena solo te apeece el menu de comprar y ya cosa que en entregas anteriores las tiendas si tenian modelados los interiores 10. No hay torre de batala eso decepciona mucho.

11. Cortaron contendio para venderlo como nuevo contenido en un dlc esta practica me asquea.

12. Se supone que es un juego de mundo abierto pero de mundo abierto no tiene nada los rivales no escalan de niveles lo cual hace que llegas con niveles 10 de mas al momento de combatir a los rivales yo llegue con nivel 80 a la elite 4 esto deja en claro lo facil que es el juego.

Es una verguenza que gamefreak sacara es juego a medias a la venta lleno de bugs y problemas claramente gamefreak no este a la altura y deberian de darle el juego a otra desarrolladora que si quiera dar lo mejor de si para crear un buen juego, lo mas triste de todo esto es que hay oersonas que defienden este juego como si fuera la cuspide de lo mejor de pokemon lo cual es una mentira lo mejor de pokemon fue en pokemon platino, HG/SS, BW/BW2 esa fue la mejor era de pokemon lo que hay hoy en dia ni se acerca a lo que alguna vez fue pokemon, espero que los de nintendo tomen cartas en el asusnto y exijan mejor calidad a pokemon los fans que realmente queremos un buen juego nos merecemos algo mejor y de buena calidad."

The pokebikes. The new forms of Paldea. The gym bosses that their clothes are so outlandish and funny.

The bad:
The formula is the same for all Pokémon and several previous games have already reached its maximum expression and now it is only being repeated over and over again with small, increasingly imperceptible improvements. The graphics engine is fair, but a decade ago it already felt old. The new designs are not well inspired, putting more creatures in the shape of everyday things with eyes is no longer funny, Going from 1000 to 2000 creatures to trap with variants was fun at first but we have been doing it since the last 25 years that it has already lost the grace. The game is full of frame drops and bugs.

The Meh!:
The release of a new canonical and official Pokemon feels like ""the Groundhog Day"" over and over again the formula is repeated, over and over again you have to choose only one of three, over and over again you have to catch them all , over and over again the Polly Pocket/Habbo hotel cartoon type graphics, over and over again dividing the fans, over and over again a color, an element a letter, a new millennial creature from somewhere that no one had ever seen before in 7-8 generations and what to say about the improvements of the previous version that do not reach this version for some reason. When there are Switch RPG games with amazing graphics like Xenoblade or NiER: Automata the excuse of ""Pokemon has always been like this"" is not worth it, even games from previous generations such as Tales of, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy,... which also have a bestiary of hundreds of creatures put the ""new"" graphics of this ""new"" Pokemon to shame"

Pros
Open World

Gameplay and Story

Cons
No Difficulty Scaling
Graphics
Game Performance

The multiplayer in this game is incredible. You can have two people (up to four) running around the world at the same time without an impact on the game’s performance, and joining raids is a cinch while linked. Granted, to do so, you need to have two switches and two copies of the game like most switch games.

The story actually put forward an effort. The characters actually had heart this game. Don’t expect anything huge, but it certainly made the game more enjoyable. Not to mention there were several points in the game where I lost battles (because I ran wherever I felt like).

Weak spots in Sword/Shield such as cooking and internet connection have dramatically improved. Cooking has become a full on crafting system. And the internet connection hasn’t caused any problems for me. I’m sure I’ll run into them someday. There’s no way Game Freak’s fixed that. Even raids have improved, allowing all players to act at the same time. No longer do you sit and do nothing as you watch the AI increase their defensive stats.

The biggest detraction from this game is the game performance. This is coming from someone who isn’t a tech genius, but at times (mostly the beginning of the game oddly enough), the screen tore. I can’t identify it in just about any other game, but in Scarlet and Violet it was obvious. And catching Pokemon is a little awkward considering where the Pokeball lands. The terrain in general is usually pretty rough as well. In summary the moves look nicer than they ever have on Switch, but everything else is lacking in the graphics department. And looking at all the bad reviews, they're dumping 0-2's purely on graphics lol.

In conclusion, this is the best Pokemon game on Switch for the casual player. If you aren’t into collecting every species, online battling, shiny hunting, or anything usually reserved for the “postgame,” Scarlet and Violet delivers a fun experience."

Some examples: ● Interaction with and between NPCs is reduced to almost 0, as the player's actions have no effect on their before and after. ● Almost non-existent side quests.

Compared to the classic series, it has many new features, some of which are really pleasant, for example, the pokemon-environment iteration is done quite well. The main problem of the game is the instability of the software, with numerous bugs, and the very poor graphic quality which ruins its immersiveness. I will not dwell on these problems both because they are many and because they are easily found by anyone. The real question is: why make such a game when you don't have the time, means and skills to do it? Something simpler is done, without trying to overturn everything, even if times go by quickly and the fans want something more.

The open world does not have much content, besides that it is a false open world, since you cannot enter the houses, and the shops have no interior, there is only a menu.

They should have worked more on the game a full year or two years.

Nintendo Switch has shown potential as a console with games like Zelda, Metroid or Xenogears, and yet with Pokemon Scarlet/Violet it feels like a game from 15 years ago, being generous.

Not to mention the bugs, glitches, popping, lack of animation, and total disinterest of the developer to pamper their game and appreciate their fans.

  ",1,"Pokemon Scarlet/Violet have succeeded in one thing: show that Game Freak or maybe the Pokemon Company do not care about their games. It has been noticeable since Sword and Shield, but has become blatantly clear with this new entry of the series. The game is clearly not finished: fps are low (≈20 fps) and textures look like a free to play game from a decade ago. The menus are clunky and slow, the animations are poorly made and the glitches are numerous. I know some people have been enjoying it but I believe we must voice our concerns and point out the lack of effort of the developper if we hope to have a decent game one day. A lot of features that were introduced in Legends:Arceus have been removed, making the game feel slower and less responsive. I feel restricted in terms of mobility in comparaison to PLA. The battles feel slower too and because of the technical difficulties, every time a battle ends there is a 1-2 second response time before anything happens which makes it very awkward and sluggish. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have been rushed and are clearly not finished in this state but I fear that even with the technical issues resolved, the game would not hold up due to the numerous feature they've cut and the obvious step back in terms of gameplay. The title of ""open world"" would not save this game in my opinion."

Disturbing not just immersion and fun, but also heavily frustrating and really hard to enjoy what all of us love to: Explore,fight,catch,train,collect,strategize and so on. Not even clothing customization....
The story was also a shallow, one-dimensional cringefest with barely any interesting plot and characters.. I know it's target audience is younger folks, but this is even to those who are maybe more simple- and open-minded about such aspects an insult to injury. Finally, this feels like I've been robbed by a fraudster company for an unfinished/broken product. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the company GAME FREAK has failed to deliver a top notch product. Most of them where underwhelming in terms of graphics and performance while they let themselves get carried by the fan's overall joy towards Pokemon. Now they have stooped this low on all accords and it would be better for Nintendo to consider another company to further take up on the future Pokemon games, because I'll keep my distance in the future towards products from GAME FREAK and probably even refuse to buy them completely."

Disappointingly, that same passion was not put into the rest of the game. The game is plagued with technical and graphical problems, as well as bland open world exploration, objectives with very little focus or direction, and a fairly dull story.
Playing this game feels like beta testing an open world expansion for Pokémon Sword/Shield. Far from the exciting new generation of the highest grossing franchise of all time that was promised.
Game freak have taken several steps backwards after the interesting shake up they brought us with Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and in future would definitely benefit from a much longer development cycle.

Set aside the 2005 graphics, and the barely acceptable animations, the game has very little to offer.
The region of Paldea is incredibly sterile: there is almost no indoor spaces, even in the big city int he middle of the region. NPCs have nothing to add tot he depth of the world, dialogues and lines mean absolutely nothing. Animations of the characters are barely acceptable.
If the artistic direction is problematic, well, the optimisation of the game in the console is unacceptable. The game struggles a lot: frame rate drops drastically in the most randome moments, characters/props and pokemon flickers constantly, and the animations of what's on the map is so slow that it looks like you're playing a stop motion videogame.
I am shocked at all the journalists and critics that gave a score higher than 4 to this game."

Scarlet & Violet cities are blank and empty instead, just built to create some repetitive shop, they dont tell anything, they just stay there to fit an empty space.

  ",1,"We are beta-testing a Pokémon open world for them.

Technical Issues:
- Performance is atrocious for a triple-AAA company releasing on a stable console OS.

- The game has serious fps drops on my new Switch OLED. I get drops that feel as low as 4-8 fps, and the game seems to barely be above 25 fps. It’s giving me a headache.

- There are shadows flickering all over the place. NPC and Pokémon shadows are barely 10 pixels each. It feels like trying to run a PC game on low because you do not meet the recommend specs.

- NPCs move around like robots at 3 FPS like a slideshow, unless you are very close to them.

- Many times the camera clips underground and you can see the abyss below. This happens often in trainer battles that are on elevated ground.

- On several occasions I have fell through the floor and had to hard-reset my Switch OLED because I was stuck in the “falling” animation.

- Character movement is so weird and clunky. You move like a robot too, snapping into a locked position when ascending/descending. Movement isn’t fluid and realistic.

- Lighting is as bad as it gets. Many times the time of day causes your character to look pitch black (even though you are white). Other times the lighting causes your character to look completely white like a ghost.

Weird Graphics:
- Graphics are atrocious in my opinion. I’d rather have the more cute, bright and “cartoony” style of SwSh than this more “realistic” style mode. It’s creepy because Pokémon now look like actual real animals.

Empty ""Open"" World:
- The world is big but barren and depressing. There is no depth and detail to anything. The world is as big as the ocean but as deep as a puddle. There is just nothing to see or do, other than traverse large distances that are empty of content.

- The cities are hollow and devoid of content. The majority of the NPCs can’t be interacted with, and all the stores pop-up Trade UI menus to buy and sell. There are no store interiors any more. They didn’t even design a simple clothing shop.

- The game is supposed to be ""open"" world saying you can do anything you want. That's a straight lie. There is a specific course set for you as nothing scales to your level/badges. What is the point of reaching a gym only to find out that your level 20 Pokemon have to face level 50 Pokemon, without ANY sort of indication that where you are going is the ""wrong"" place. This forces you to either follow the set path, or grind levels to beat an over-leveled gym, while returning back to previous gyms to find out your now level 50 Pokemon have to face level 10 gym leaders.

Character:
- Character customization is terrible. There are only 4 outfits that are just ugly. Tights pants that are orange with stripes? Who thought of that? It’s like you are wearing clown pants. Every player looks the same now. There is zero diversity. Zero role playing value. The accessories you can change (gloves/hat/bag) are a few recolors that feel pointless since the main attire is disgusting. SwSh had the best clothing options, especially with the DLCs. You could role-play as anything. Not any more. You are stuck wearing clown-pants with suspenders throughout the game.

Pokémon:
- The new Pokémon are mediocre. They are literally a pig, a flamingo (named Flamigo), and a few birds. It looks like Animal Planet. Not a Pokémon game.

Verdict:
This is definitely an early alpha version of the game released to the public. People need to start getting fired at Game Freak because this garbage is not a video game. This is really sue-able; especially if they do not offer refunds"

  ",1,"Je joue a tout les jeux pokemon depuis leurs sortie sur game boy, j'ai découvert les amélioration technique et scénaristique, les jeux ont changer depuis XY qui à mes yeux est le vrais dernier jeu pokemon avec de beau graphisme, de bonne idée de gameplay et un bon scenario, pokemon scarlet est tres mauvais, visuelement moche avec énormément de texture floue, des models 3D ultra simpliste et une construction de l’environnement maladroit avec des montagnes qui ne ressemble a rien, un énorme aliasing surtout visible sur dock, du poping, des pnj qui ont un cycle d'anime qui se remet a zero quand on regarde ailler, et surtout d'énorme baisse d'fps
Pour l'histoire maleureusement on reste toujours tres bas, il n'y a aucun dialogue doublé rien à changer de ce coté là depuis l'épisode game boy, nous avons aussi dans ce jeu des personnages tres insuportable qui font constamment des intervention ou arrive de nullepart pour nous parler avec toujours cette ambiance niaise

Le jeu est TRES TRES facile, je n'ai pas encore vue un seul obstacle, notre rival nous donne constamment des objets de soin à chaque obstacle, aucun dresseur nous propose de combat au contraire nous devons allez leurs parlé pour avoir un combat ce qui est une énorme erreur à mes yeux, on n'a plus le stresse de ne pas réussir une arène ou réussire a arriver a la prochaine ville, d'ailleur pour la difficulté j'ai remarquer que les pokemons sauvages ont moins tendances à te foncé dessus te risquant d'avoir un combat, on peut facilement les esquivé.

Pour la cohérence de l'univers en dehors des doublages inexistant, il n'y a pas de bonne mise en scene, les pokemons sauvages ne semble pas avoir de volonté propre et ne font que se déplacé sur la map là ou les dévelopeurs ont posé leurs spawn, aucun pokemon n'attaque d'aute pokemons par exemple, ou fait des grand trajet juste une mini zone et on va les voir pour en capturé un ...
Les pnj aussi sont plat, allé retour, sur place avec une boucle d'anim totalement visible, des pnj qui se resembles les un les autres, aucune fluidité ou réaliste est apporté là dessus, ce qui donne l'impression d'etre entouré de robots

Les villes sont malheureusement juste là pour faire beau, la plus part des bâtiments sont copier collé, avec aucune possibilité de rentré et discuté avec les habitant, meme la grande ville est vide avec des escalier géant, des rue aussi grandes que des stade de foot, et des magasin copier collé sans intérieur, simplement un menu ...

Notre personnage principal est ... bizarre, très neutre pour avoir qu'un seul style d'animation, le garçon et la fille ont pratiquement la meme tete et les mêmes proportions, ce qui donne une mauvaise impression de garçon manqué, ou de fille garçonne, ce qui ne plaira ni a fan des anciens personnages féminin ou masculin,qui avais chacun leurs charisme (parfois on relancer une partie juste pour joué l'autre personnage) Pour notre personnage et les pnj tout semble etre fait pour aller vite, les enfants et ado ont les memes animations, les femmes et homme aussi, et ils ont meme mis des femmes ultra costaux sans aucune explications sauf pour recyclé les animations des hommes musclé

Les musiques sont aussi tres mauvaise, composé par un indépendant, qui a fait des jeux que certains peuvent aimé, mais ça n'en fait pas un mec super fort en musique sachant qu'il y a beaucoup d’excellent compositeur déjà pressant dans la série, toby fox à surement son style de musique, mais elles sonnes plates et répétitive quand on joue, surtout dans un open world comme celui ci.

Le jeu soufre principalement des choix de gamefreak, une petite équipe qui n'a pas envie de faire du gros jeux, peut de temps ce qui fait maleureusement de mauvais jeux chaque année, là avant sur console portable certains choix pouvais etre accepté, sur une console de salon de nombreus souci ne sont plus excusable surtout quand on sais qu'ils peuvent faire mieux et qu'il n'y a aucune pression financière sur le projet, j'espere que les critiques négative vont permettre au studio de changé , proposer des jeux meilleurs"

  ",0,"Unfortunately, more of the same mediocrity that has been bogging down the franchise for years.
Taking even a cursory at glance at any other major Nintendo franchise, or even a majority of AAA franchises period, the shortcomings and limitations of Pokémon become impossible to ignore.

Violet and Scarlet may move some aspects of the franchise forward, namely in the open-world environments and less linearity, but still suffer from a chronic lack of ambition, scope, and polish.

Ever since the franchise's transition into 3D with XY in 2013, Gamefreak have been open about their desire to remove features, difficulty and complexity from the franchise, in an attempt to appeal to the ""kids of today"". Unfortunately, coupled with an increasingly brutal yearly release schedule, this has led most modern Pokémon games feeling barebones, empty, and at times, unfinished.

TL:DR - The abysmal performance and presentation of these games alone would be enough for me to not recommend them, but the added context of how little Gamefreak are utilising the Switch, how much better far smaller franchises consistently are, and the rapid rate between releases, just make the situation so, so much worse.

In 2022, Pokémon has far more in common with franchises like FIFA, Call Of Duty, and Assassins Creed, than other premium Nintendo franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Kirby."

Hay una mejora notoria en cuanto al decorado de los ambientes y las texturas del pelaje de los Pokémon está muy bien logrado. Se nota que le han puesto empeño al diseño de los Pokémon, pero hasta ahí. El juego tiene más fallos que puntos positivos y es una pena porque el juego sería mil veces más disfrutable sin esa bajada de FPS tan grandes y constantes. También que el juego se cierre constantemente y tenga tantos fallos de programación. Recomiendo explorar a pie que utilizar la montura para que el juego le de tiempo a cargar los Pokémon. De lo contrario, se queda un mundo vacío que te asaltan Pokémon que aparecen bajo tus pies. Pokémon Leyendas Arceus es la verdadera experiencia de mundo abierto y de exploración que debería seguir mimando Nintendo (o incluso zonas amplias como las vistas en Pokémon Espada y Escudo) y dejar la aventura por rutas a los juegos principales. Nada de mundos gigantescos que luego se sabe que no van a rendir bien por el año que tienen desarrollando cada juego principal de Pokémon.

En conclusión: un juego roto y con un rendimiento inaceptable. Pretende ser un Pokémon Leyendas Arceus cuando el equipo de programación no está habituado trabajar en 3D ni puede terminar un proyecto tan ambicioso con la exigencia empresarial de año por desarrollo. Eso es literalmente IMPOSIBLE y siento que el equipo directivo lleva un tiempo que no tiene claro la EXPERIENCIA QUE QUIERE PLASMAR EN CADA NUEVA ENTREGA DE LOS JUEGOS PRINCIPALES, lo que hace que su continuidad parezca un popurrí de ideas beta que les da igual cómo quede con tal de que salga al mercado y sigan ganando dinero."

PS: Game Freak won't bother to fix bugs. They know they're going to sell millions of copies and that it's always going to stay that way. Now they will be starting to develop the video game that comes out in 2023."

The game does work but not smoothly. it lacks content, like enterable houses and clothes customization. And more side quests. For an open world game you also want to see things that are not Pokémon related like helping people in their daily lives. Bugs and glitches show more problems and make the game feel awkward. It is obvious that the game needs 2-3 more years of development like Xenoblade which got released after 5-7 years. Textures are low resolution. You can spot 3 pixel wide textures on railings that also got blurred out, so i guess that is smooth. Animations are good, especially cutscenes are well executed. The graphics inside are also of higher quality and one might wonder how the game would look like if that was applied on the exterior as well. The player models and Pokémon look fantastic with detailed skin textures and a lively appearance which get disrupted by LOD issues close up. The music is the best part of the game.

I grew up with Pokémon and always bought games on release. PLA was a masterpiece in my eyes as it brought fresh new mechanics and a new way to experience Pokémon. Of course I was delighted when I saw Scarlet and Violet being announced and being open world. This must have been a dream come true. So fast forward to a bad marketing company, the games content leaking early and finally the game releasing.

Now, I was never the person to blatantly insult a game despite bad graphics and low frame rates but god damn. This is just something else. I played it for 8+ hours and it really saddens me seeing my favorite franchise ending up in such a state. The performance issues were so bad that we were literally thinking that my switch was broken. We tried it on my girlfriend's for about 2 hours just to see that it is in fact the game. Additionally information has come out that there is a memory leak in the game. As a long time software developer myself I was stunned to see that a game gets shipped / released without proper testing. I knew that this was common for triple A studios such as CD Project Red with Cyberpunk but as a first party developer of Nintendo this might be the worst release of a Nintendo exclusive title. I already set the bar low when it comes to Game Freak but this time they need to sit down and reflect and maybe consider expanding or handing the Mainline games to someone that actually cares. I will ask for a refund and will not be part of the problem anymore. And no I won't buy it again after they fixed it. I am done."

- The Pokemon designs not only are the most forgettable in the franchise, but they feel out of place, incoherent, even BAD.
- Not that Gigantamax was great, but Terracrystalization simply isn't well implemented, like other new mechanics. Once you use it, you have to go back to a Pokemon center and recharge it, so you'll end up using it around 10 times in the whole game.
- About the story and structure, one cannot help but compare it to Fire Emblem Three Houses with its multiple paths, the academy, etc., but it looks GameFreak just forgot about a good cast, memorable situations and any sort of good story. And let's obviate the tehcnical optimisation.

However, the new region finds some charm here and there, inspired by the Spanish and Portuguese cultures (as Sword and Shield so well did), mainly in the interior designs and the exterior of houses. The bigger size of the region, helps the game feel more immersive at times, although at the same time, the lack of coherence and engage makes it also feel more inert than ever. It feels rather empty.

Overall, they are fine game. If you're expecting a Pokemon game, these are Pokemon games. But their inspiration and polish leave a lot to desire. It tries more than Sword and Shield. Fails much more than Sword and Shield. Better than Legends Arceus? Sure. Some additions are welcome, but the thing is that for each one of them there are 5 mistakes or downgrades.
With great potential, Scarlet and Violet fall near the bottom of the franchise, but still make for a decent game."

Por otro lado, también está lo positivo, que realmente solo es la historia y el modo cooperativo online, más allá de eso, solo es un producto decepcionante al cual no le han puesto ni el más minimo esfuerzo ni amor para hacerlo

No recomiendo gastar tu tiempo y dinero en juegos como este, solo queda esperar a que saquen un parche que por lo menos arreglen el rendimiento tan pobre que tiene."

Das erste was man in diesem Spiel zu sehen bekommt und sich in das Auge einbrennt ist dieser massive Textur Matsch. Bei fortlaufendem Spielfluss muss man feststellen, das man pausenlos durch belanglose und nervtötende Textboxen klicken muss und auch die etwaigen Anwortmöglichkeiten innerhalb dieser ""Unterhaltungen"" sind völlig Sinnbefreit und machen keinerlei unterschied für dich als Spieler, da es das Spiel in keinster weise verändert.
Die Kämpfe selbst sind ganz ok bis gut gemacht, wobei ich sagen muss das ich festgestellt habe, das wenn ein Pokemon in Schlaf Status versetzt wurde, hatte es trotzdem die Augen nicht geschlossen und man sieht diese ZzZzZ schlaf animierten Buchstaben bei geöffneten Augen....creepy ich schlaf iwi bei geschlossenen Augen.
In diesem Spiel kann man so viel räumlich glitchen, Pokemon die iwo in Wänden auch während eines Kampfes fest hängen. Kamera die unter den Boden durchschauen kann. Dieses Grafik-desaster,
welches nur im Jahre 2004 ein Augenschmaus gewesen wäre und Performance von Fps/3D-Modellen/Textur ist die Hölle. Nicht hier anzusehen macht irgendwie Spaß, das einzige was es fördert ist Augenkrebs.
Gamefreak hat hier eine unfertige pre-Alpha zum Kauf angeboten und ich wünschte ich hätte es nicht Day 1 gespielt, jedoch hatte mir Schwert Spaß bereitet, aber das hier ist Kot mit Kot oben drauf.
Danke Gamefreak das ich Geld für euren Kot ausgeben durfte!"

I thought the lack of pokemon (dexit) would have made me frustrated with the game but the lineup has been the best in the series so far. That being said. This game only has 1/3 of the pokemon and still fails to deliver a smooth experience. Surely that 2/3 of pokemon implementation could of gone into improving the games barren environment or cyberpunk-like state of game Game Freak knew they were developing for the switch. Therefore it was there duty to make a game that could function on it. The weary visuals and clippings are what you find in alpha stage games which makes the game feels rushed and half baked.

It's odd. The Gameplay is solid and is well fleshed out yet the world and performance is not. If you are tempted to buy this game but are out off by the negative reviews, I would save your money and wait to see what TPC does next. Wether they patch the bugs or whether they just release more pokemon hostage via DLC...

If you are looking for a beautiful monster catching game on the switch. Why not try TemTem? It is an MMO, however its a spiritual pokemon successor without the coprate greed that pokemon has inherited nowadays Will happily change my review IF they remove the Cyberpunk our of the game"

This game is just unacceptable.
I could have accepted the perfomance issues, the glitches and the bugs if the game was actually fine.
However the open world is a dead and empty huge map with nothing to do. Dungeons are a joke, they are just go from point A to point B.
You cannot even explore cities and villages, as you cannot enter in most of the buildings and the shops are just UI menus copied and pasted all over.
No fun, no challenge, poor performance, bugged as hell. I won't buy Pokémon games anymore if this is the quality they propose."

El único fallo es el tema de los bugs, q hay muchos. Y como detalle por ponerme crítica diría que cuesta de ver los pokemons, al igual sí los hicieran más grandes serían más fáciles de ver. Y, personalmente, la paleta de colores de espada y escudo me gustaba más. Pero sigo diciendo q esto son detalles menores. Me gusta la historia, el poder hacer realmente lo q quieras. El que hayan clases, gimnasios y dos historias más. Me parece que la saga va por buen camino. Ah! Una cosa más, me encantaría que se pudiera volver a entrar en las casas ajajja me encantaba entrar en ellas a buscar cosas.

Beyond the graphical glitches and all that (which are extremely notable and upsetting, but we know about those) this game is clearly completely rushed and unfinished. For the first time i’m series history you cannot enter a single NPC house, and what few shops you can enter, 90% of them are menus. Towns are empty and lifeless, and have nothing fun to run around an d look at, most of the npcs have little to nothing to say at all, shops are copy and pasted all over in the main town with nothing else to do at all!!

the pokémon and player models look really good actually,,, unless you’re more than 3 inches away!! Get a few feet away and they turn into laggy stuttering low poly distractions, even further back and they start to flicker in and out like a sad ghost. it’s downright distracting.

Don’t even get me started on the battles, IMO legends arceus fully perfected the battle system, perfectly streamlined fast and exciting, with engaging new modes and ways to spice things up. animations were on point, interactive, and excepting, this game completely guts every single aspect of that in favor of a slow, bogged down, un interactive boring back and forth that is boring and a chore. Also they removed the ability to throw poke balls in the wild you have to initiate battle again ://

I want to love this game so much, I truly do, and there are parts of it that feel fun, but it is all wrapped in a package of horrible optimized, completely underbaked (I would go as far as to say fully uncooked) embarrassingly atrocious .. I don’t even know what."

It's ugly. The game feels zmpty and surface level. I am not far into the story so i can't talk about it, but there is a serious lack of depth in my opinion. The routes feel generic and bland, almost as though they were proceduraly generated, and so bland, colorless and ugly due to poor textures. The picnic feature just doesn't give you thesame level of intolacy withyour pokemons. And now you can't go into houses. There is barely any interior places to expnore, scrapped for sure to make way for the development of open world. I looove open world, i love wandering aimlessly into samey looking scenery and bumping constantly into pokemons that i couldn't see cause of my riding pokemon's fat tail (sarcasm).

Please don't let other reviews dissaude you. Gameplay-wise, this may be the best Pokemon game I've played, and I've played all of them. It's by far the most fun for me.
The only issues so far have been minor glitchy behaviour/low FPS mostly from background characters and animated objects, which personally don't really bother me at all, since none of it really affects gameplay; as well as a lack of clothing customisation in terms of not being able to wear a skirt or a dress, which kinda bugs me. But again, these are minor, trivial problems that have not been a detriment to my experience in nearly 40hrs of gameplay already. Any casual or veteran pokemon fans will enjoy this as long as you're not terminally online and/or very easily annoyed by buggy graphics. Content creators and news outlets online benefit from outrage, and these bugs are a very easy thing to point at to make people upset at a game they haven't experienced for themselves yet.
Overall I would strongly recommend this game to the majority of Pokemon fans and newcomers to the series alike. It just might be hard to go back to older games after playing through a game this fun."

I can't help but feel that Nintendo/Gamefreak rushed this game out pre-maturely to slot it in with the holiday sales window for 2022 when it clearly needed to be delayed. The game targets 30 FPS but often fails to achieve that with frequent glitches and dips into the single digit frame rates. I attempted to catch a Psyduck only for pokeballs to glitch through the ground and the camera angles to show a 'black' zone outside the bounds of the map. Nintendo slowly chips away at the 'Nintendo seal of quality' with each modern mainline Pokemon game released these last 5 years. Nintendo has shown their hand and they are more than willing to sacrifice on quality to make a quick buck at player's expense. Cannot recommend this game in good faith unless it recieves considerable patches to improve performance.

As a game development company, if you don't pay attention to the technology of game development, the gap will only be widened by other companies.

However, the game is just not good for several reasons: the game is completely infested with immersion breaking bugs, there isn't a point to sharing the world as there is very little multiplayer content to chew on other than raids, the game feels directionless and exploration just amounts to catching different pokemon without every truly feeling like you are discovering anything, team star... I don't understand what they are or what their goals are or why they are even a threat but all of the characters seem to not like them, the mounted controls feel very shallow and jank, absolutely horrid pop in, many assests seem to be stop animated even at close range, the gym challenges are more annoying than anything, the majority of npcs have horrible designs, trainer battles can be completely skipped, many of the new pokemon designs are either wack or lazy, and even though this is a personal issue I can't get over the hats when the pokemon terrastilize it looks so dumb... I could go on.

TLDR: There are some good ideas but I cannot recomend this game to anyone based on its many flaws both from a design and technical standpoint."

The battle setting is awful, there is always a rock or a stripe of fake grass that gets you out of the atmosphere of the game by looking at how it was poorly texturized. Animations are cartoonish, and by that i mean that they are pre-Disneyan; actual ""switching drawings on a book"" level of FPS and overall very unnatural [i.e: when coraidon jumps, it looks like frog jumping with the gravity of the moon in a triangular trajectory (yes, i said triangular, not parabolic)]. You can't get inside people's house, you are immerse in a desolated land in low res and low poly, doing the same thing you've done for all these years of playing Pokémon in a much worse and lifeless environment. Most important of all, everything is bugged like it was programmed by monkeys. And they charge you 60€ for that. Insane. This is a multi-billion dollar company. The level of scam is unprecedented. An indie game done this bad, would have been removed From the Nintendo shop, if it wasn't done by Scam freak.

- No bugs/glitches/clipping that are to annoying, again Scarlet and Violet is full of that. Almost every fight i've had except the one where you can't control the camera, for the rest, almost every one of them have clipping issues.

Speaking of outdated, yeah the graphics are still like a 3DS game and the performance is bad. Pop ins are terrible and the framerate is very unstable. This might be better in handheld mode but its still not acceptable for a 60$ game. At least the game doesnt crash or has broken quests.

We don’t need a game every year GameFreak, what we need is a game to be proud of!!! As a Pokémon fan, I’m really sad. I never complained about Sword/Shield and I think the Isle or Armor was visually better than Paldea. I was so excited for SV and the idea of exploring an open **** it looks so unfinished, it’s unreal. Please treat us with some respect! This is not an Indie game!

Xenoblade 3 looks and runs great on the switch. Gamefreak is the problem, not the hardware. Looks like a muddy wasteland.
Legends arceus was a step in the right direction. What happened here?

Pokémon is the highest grossing media franchise in global history, yet Gamefreak can't be bothered to release a finished game. You need to add voice acting (why do you even bother animating lip movement, incredibly awkward); significantly improve graphics and animations; balance megas and add them back in; and actually finish the product for release.

Second the map will just disappear and you could fall through it or have it break immersion and the camera is awful. Third there are many issues with the character models and issues with the Pokémon. Also they don’t explain that you actually need to battle gyms first pretty much because your Pokémon will not listen to you after a certain level so if you wanted to complete the other two stories first good luck. The open world also doesn’t feel right with trainers being scattered around and there isn’t many of them. Also the Pokémon pop in out of nowhere and they are tiny. You could be running and have a random Pokémon spawn under you or walk into you and you won’t even see it. The battle system also feels stale and broken after playing Legends Arceus. This game lacks polish and needed a few more months and some play testing. I wouldn’t recommend it at all until they patch the game to a point where it’s playable.

This is the same copy and paste game and I’ll be honest, games like Let’s Go Eevee had more heart and soul.

The water doesn't look anywhere near as bad as the two games I just listed, and at its worst, SV will experience some momentary FPS drops. When it comes to the actual game, it is one of the pokemon games I have enjoyed the most. The open world allows for the player to essentially do whatever they please as soon as the Treasure Hunt begins. There is no set path, and you can immediately start tackling the more challenging areas if that is what you desire. The best part is that the handholding is kept at a minimum. These two things are what the fanbase has been asking for since BOTW's conception, and Gamefreak did a nice job doing this. The game also provides what I believe to be, a hard hitting story, with the 3 main characters who you help along the way. Arven, Nemona, and Penny. All 3 are very compelling and I felt instant attachment to each one. This is the most pleased I have been with the story as far as I can remember.

The game severely lacks polish with its terrible graphics, bad performance and unacceptable amount of glitches. Ignoring the technical issues, the game lacks the kind of content that made the older games so beloved. The postgame amounts to an extra 40 minutes of story to conclude the game, a **** battle facility (calling it that is not even really accurate), 6/7 star raids and a wild area-esque area for catching Paradox Pokémon. **** GSC had more content than this, and that was on a 2 MB cartridge for a 20 year old console. Hell, Crystal even has a Battle Tower, which this game lacks. There's no excuse.

Honestly, I haven't even touched on the various problems I have with this game, but pointing out the main ones should be enough to tell you everything you need to know about it. It is not acceptable for a game from the biggest franchise in the world to be released in this state at full price, and if there isn't a series of patches to fix the numerous issues with the game, then I would be very dissapointed.

And now how they were rated by the community, too. I don't think the game is a step backwards on that. Yes, the game sometimes runs with less fps than in Legends Arceus. But the graphics look better overall. In addition, there are many things that make Scarlet and Violet better. The open world, for example, fascinates me even more. Unfortunately my english is not the best. So let's make it short: Scarlett and Violet are one of the best Pokémon Games I have ever played. I would normally give an 8.

I was going into this game with a lot of hope this would finally revive the Pokémon franchise and be a first step into getting Pokémon games up to par with the current tipple A market, and in some ways it is just that, but the bugs, horrid FPS, and other performance issues make this game outright unplayable for me. Every time you dare to move your character or screen your FPS drops significantly which not only stuns your character for a bit, but also distracts you from the game; also, when you attempt to enter any sort of battle or cutscene the game just freezes for a noticeable second. I’ll just be honest and say that this game does do a lot of the things us Pokémon fans were asking for; it has an open world system, it lets the player tackle gyms/objectives in the order they like, it has following Pokémon, and it has better graphics than any other Pokémon games (including arceus); however, I just can’t get myself to enjoy the experience due to all the lagg and bugs. Also, anyone trying to say that the lag and bugs are acceptable since this is a switch game is overlooking the fact that Breath of the Wild runs on the switch just fine, so don’t even try or excuse the half assed state that this game is in right now. Overall, this situation is just another example **** company just sending out their game in a horrid condition because they don’t give a **** I’m just sad this happened to Pokémon scarlet and violet since for the first time in a long time I had hope this game could actually rival other triple a tittles."

The graphics are beyond poor, the game lags, and even simple things like opening a shop menu take far too long.
The open world feels mostly soulless and also a bit too big at times - there is very little incentive to stray off the path and explore.
Some of the new pokemon designs are good but many leave a lot to be desired, being odd or just downright ugly.
I was hopeful this slightly different setting of the academy might breathe some fresh life into the game but it just seems like the same old game as always - just worse in almost every regard.

I didn't even attempt the gyms or any of the main content, because the overall performance ruined the experience. Riding your mount is particularly stressful as the environment pops in at random. The open world is sparse and makes Arceus look damn near next gen in comparison.

This game's technical issues are abysmal, especially for a high budget triple A title like Pokemon. Personally, I haven't encountered any bugs other than the horrible frame issues that range from tolerable to borderline unplayable, but the former is the most common. Under all of that, there is a great game here. The gameplay is the freshest it has been in a mainline entry since the DS games, and as the first truly open world Pokemon, it works really well. Even with the frame issues, I've had a lot of fun. Especially compared to the former titles, Sword & Shield. Honestly, you can say a lot about Game Freak as a company nowadays, but in all fairness the frame glitches and bugs were even in the trailer for these games. So, I can say I do not understand why people are so shocked as it wasn't very hidden. In the end, is this a fun game? Yes. Should you buy it? No, not until they release a heavy patch update, even then I feel the 60 dollar price tag is too much.

  ",2,"As a long pokemon fan, i find this game insulting in many ways. I had always tried to find the good in all the last pokemon games to find em more enjoyable and fun, but this is just unacceptable.

First, let's pretend this is a finished product (when it is clearly not) subjectively find the design of the new pokemon really lame and poorly inspired, the worst generation by far. Too much humanoid evolution and so many weird evolution. That is just my taste though so it wont matter much in the score.

The story and narrative is good at times but quite bad and messy overall.
The difficulty is completely unbalanced, since level scaling dont exist and as such you can trivialize most of the challenges simply chosing a certain order.
I dont expect much from a pokemon game in these two categories though, so i can let that slide.

The real problem is: the game is totally void. It is big in its scope, but devoid of any type of activity, sidequest, interaction with npc. City are totally empty and useless, the open world is big without a level design. You just roam around to pick items at some point, since if you challenge all the trainer you will fing yourself overlevelled, unless you constantly change your party making it weaker on purpose. I am not even talking about team star base and ""boss"", such a disappontment

The quality of life is  reduced from some of his previous interaction, you cannot turn down the animation and fight style is fixed on set, so you cannot decide to turn it down from option, just like the exp share.

Honestly, a pokemon game even in its lowest moment managed to be fun since its core gameplay is extremely rewarding and functional per se, even considering its poor story, childish character development, low difficlutybut and mid to low level design in puzzle and exploration. This time they manage to make a pokemon game almost boring, even as a die hard fan.

That would be a 6 for me, if not for the fact that this game is not finished. It should not have been sold in this state, it is like a alpha rather than a finished product.
Aside for the low quality res and texture, except for the pokemon model which are greatly improved from the previous game, everything is a mess.
Performance is really bad, 15 fps in some moment even lower, despite being few object on screen,
camera angle problem, glitch, soft lock and some real issue about lighting and npc modeling.

The switch is not the problem, optimization is.

It is one of the best regions and it perfectly refines what has been achieved with Legends Arceus, graphically its a great leap in quality, and in terms of exploration, it is something that the saga would hardly have dreamed of years ago.
Accessibility and quality of life improvements are much better, making the competitive something more open to all audiences.
In story, its one of the best that the saga has had, and the inclusiveness that this game brings goes with the quality line that others have had in Nintendo lately.

In the current state this game is in, it's absolutely unforgivable for a $60 game to ship like this. The camera is clunky, the frame rates chug, the pop-in is horrendeous, the textures are repetetive or not there at all. Gamefreak is crunching and churning out lackluster games and its showing.

  ",4,"When the game works it's pretty fun, exploring the open world, catching beasts, and doing the story at any order you want is great.  Being able to find creative ways to tackle Pokemon stronger than you is fun and the story is actually pretty good. All things considered the game is actually fun but there is one little probem and that is...

THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED!

That's right this game is definetely unfinished because the performance is not bad in the well it's a Switch game bad no it's completely broken.  While anyone should expect lower resoltuion and low frametates of around 25-30fps due to being an Open World game on the Switch this game is worse, much worse.  Framerates dip into the single digit category here folks. Anytime you are in the open world it feels like molasses.  Not only is the frame rate poor but there's slow down gallore. The game can barely run.  The Switch is going at full power trying to run this unoptimize nightmare.  But not only is the framerate and speed of the game faulty but there's a constant gallery of glitches and bugs.  Things pop in and out worse than Sonic in Frontiers going at Mach 4 it's embarrasing.  Things in the background look like bad n64 games. You will see inside walls, the ground and even inside the very people themselves. THE MENUS, THE MENUS LAG! Heck even the LOAD SCREEN LAGS!  Overall because of the performance I can not recommend this game to anyone until GF fixes this."

  ",0,"This game is an absolute huge steaming pile of worthless garbage. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a game that is completely broken. It doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. Wait, did I say $60? These greedy developers continue the Pokemon tradition by cutting the game in half and selling it separately for $60 each. So in reality this game is worth $120. Imagine charging $120 for an indie quality game, not to mention how broken it is. This outrageous greed makes EA, Activision, Take-Two, Ubisoft, Sony, Microsoft, CDPR, Square Enix, and just about any greedy game company I can think of look like literal saints in comparison. They should have delayed the game, but these greedy developers clearly rushed it out for that Christmas money.

Not only is this game a buggy mess, it is full of game breaking glitches. The FPS is beyond horrible, I even had a section of the game where it ran 1 frame every 5 seconds. I had the game crash on me multiple times. The textures are absolutely terrible. The ground textures are laughable. It literally look like they were taken from a Nintendo 64 game. Did I forget to mention how late these textures load in? This is literally PS2 quality for $120. Too many performance and clipping issues. I saw NPCs walking towards invisible walls. Speaking of which, some of my Pokemon turned invisible. There is too much freaking lag, and keep in mind that I wasn't even playing multiplayer when I was experiencing all this lag. I could write a novel on the amount of glitches this game has, but I think I made my point. Even if this game gets fixed, that doesn't change the fact that these greedy and lazy developers had the audacity to charge $120 for a mobile game.

The AI is incredibly stupid. The physics are a complete joke and so is the soundtrack. The animations are so terrible, it literally looks like a shovelware game. Those stupid pokemon monsters that turn into bikes is the most cringeworthy thing I have ever seen in my life, not to mention how horrible the bike mechanics are. I played shovelware and mobile games with better motorcycles physics and animations than these piece of trash bikes. That is embarrassing. The sand literally looks like it was made with Microsoft Paint. The combat is boring and repetitive. I should be seeing combat that has the detail and animations of the Pokemon anime. All the lazy developers did is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. There is loading screens when entering interiors. That is pathetic. This is a 2022 $120 game, I should be able to enter the interiors in real-time at that outrageous price. The floors are magically floating in a black sky. The developers heavily advertised the ability to make a sub sandwich, which is nothing more than a gimmick that gets old. How about the spend time actually improving the gameplay instead of coming up with gimmicks. Better yet, how about they fix this joke ****.

The multiplayer is complete trash. These developers are so cheap, they can't even be bothered to spend their budget on voice acting. This isn't the 90's. Voice acting should be a staple on $60-$120 games. I demand a full refund for this game. I don't recommend this poor excuse **** at all. I don't know anyone in their right mind that would think this broken garbage is worth $60, let alone $120. Game Freak are the greediest and laziest penny-pinching cheapskate developers ever known to mankind."

  ",4,"This game sadly is not good at all. I like the direction the game goes to, but everything good has at least 3 bad things overshadowing it. It is also clear that Game Freak went for the open world style not because they had a good vision they wanted to execute, but because they wanted to squeeze money out of that very successful trend, especially looking to BoTW, without even realising how far they missed the mark.

The gameplay (when it is not just a buggy mess) is pretty good. Just usual Pokemon stuff you would expect.

The art direction is pretty interesting, and most things look a lot better designed.

The technology of this game doesn't even compare to N64 titles. Constant graphic glitches (I am not kidding, you will constantly see some kind of graphic error). The game is in a comparable technical state as Cyberpunk 2077. NPC's, your player character, and the world around you just casually glitch out at any given time. The FPS are bad, not even cracking 30 FPS. And that is just sad if you look at what the Switch usually is capable of if you give your games enough time, which Game Freak clearly did not do.

Graphics are as bad as a NGC game today. It is not doing the Nintendo Switch any justice, and could have been easily improved to at least 3DS or Wii U standards. If Game Freak really would try, they could easily do it, but not in 3 years.

Animations are as robotic as they have been since X/Y. The only difference is: X/Y is 9 years old, and was the first fully 3D pokemon title. There are some exceptions though: The main characters have some good looking animations in certain cutscenes, that even feel natural.

The sound is pretty mediocre, as it has been since OR/AS. It is not bad, but not outstanding as well.

Overall it breaks my heart that Game Freak just does not care about the customers. They throw half backed lackluster games on the market, because the executives force them to. And I am sick of fans defending them like their own family. People would often say: ""The Pokemon Company forces Game Freak to rush their games"", or the classic ""What else can you do on the Switch? It has not enough power"", which is just mind boggling to me. Game Freak is part owner of the Pokemon Company, so clearly TPC doesn't dictate Game Freak to do anything. And for the power of the Nintendo Switch: look at BoTW, look at Xenoblade Chronicles, look at Mario Kart 8 (which originally has been released on the Wii U), and you are gonna tell me the Switch does not have enough power?! Game Freak just needs to do it right, give the games more time, but they clearly don't feel the need to do that even with nearly unlimited money, because the hardcore fan boys and girls buy it anyway and defend them with their own lives. I hope Game Freak gets a well needed wake-up call."

I wanted to buy Violet, but then I've started to see the reviews by ''specialized critics'' here and all over the internet, and I've thought ''mmm, maybe waiting is better''
I've started to watch some livestreams on Twitch to see the game
Best decision I've ever done
Games without a soul, published in a FEW MONTHS (Pokémon Legends came out at the beginning of this year if you don't remember it) just because childish **** were impatient for the new generation
But hey, the game will sell anyway, so why publish it in 2 years?
The major responsibles of this disaster are exactly the consumers
I can understand those who say ''I want to buy it because I want to touch it with my hands in order to judge them''
But those who always say ''Even though the game will **** I will buy it because I want to see the new pokémon'' or ''because I want to have the new pokémon game in my collection just to expose it'' or ''because I don't want to miss the new generation''
if you only care about the fu**ing monsters play Pokémon GO and Unite, I've got both of them, and they're cool
If you only care about mere phisic possession of the game you're nothing but SLAVES
Pokémon is dying from the beginning of the 6th gen (including the remakes of Hoenn and Sinnoh which are not bad, but so far away from Heartgold and Soulsilver), and you don't even realize it
Well, keep attacking Pokémon BW, not my favorite games in the franchise, but of course the most underrated
Unova games were gold compared to this
60 EURO for THIS is just undefendable
Of course congratulations to you TPC for being so superficial
But at the same time congrats to you guys who don't care if buying Garbodor, motivate them to make even more Garbodor

Whilst the aging switch hardware is a limitation, there many other better looking and more expansive games that run way better than this.

If somehow you can get past all the performance issues (I couldn't) the game play itself feels mediocre at best. A lot of the innovation introduced by Arceus is ignored here.

Music and sound is poor with weird silences throughout and the lack of voice acting for a fully realized 3D adventure is disappointing.
