The Story might even be worse than the story of Conquest, it hurts, especially if you enjoyed the other two games. The gameplay is decent, but this is mainly due to the Fire Emblem formula being awesome to begin with. Map design isn't great and you just get way too many (under-leveld) units."

  ",10,"I absolutely loved Revelation but was annoyed that it could only be bought on the nintendo eshop. At first i didn't want to buy the third path but i'm glad I did. Refusing to take sides, trying to gather allies to stop an evil threat felt even better here. The low point is that there are too many plotholes here. There were plotholes in Birthright and Conquest but not as much.Fire Emblem Fates was my first game in the series. I enjoyed every path and rated a 10/10 each time because each iteration had a good plot, especially Conquest, had a awesome gameplay each time, each path felt different from the others (with Revelation being even more interesting due to the fact you refuse to take sides) and i never felt bored.  All the bashing and hate about this game is a mystery to me.. Maybe i'll find other fire emblem games even better but this one was the first and the one that made me fall in love withe the fire emblem games."

While it's story could certainly go for some improvements in several areas, everything else from it's gameplay and map design across all 3 pathways are varied, well made and has  something for all types of fe fans, to it's top notch soundtrack and voice acting. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and I understand why so many others dislike it but maybe, if you want, give it or at least one pathway a 2nd shot and maybe with all 3 reviews in mind, you might see it in a different light."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem: Fates is, surprisingly, an astonishingly worthy follow-up to its predecessor, Awakening. While it may not appeal to those in the fanbase looking for a hardcore, merciless strategy-RPG, Fates is extremely entertaining.

Fates continues Awakening's move towards accessibility and lowering the bar to entry - Casual mode returns, and most weapons no longer break after multiple uses (save for healing staves and rods). Revelation, in comparison to Birthright and Conquest, brings an end to the story those two games began, setting aside the option to explore two divergent paths in favour of a singular, cliché conclusion that is very much the standard for most of the games in the series (an evil dragon god of some sort being at the heart of all the evil in the game). While Fates' story is less compelling than Awakening's increased depth in certain areas (especially some of the game's mechanics) combined with the aforementioned lower bar to entry makes this a great time, and invites multiple playthroughs.

If you enjoyed Awakening, I can almost guarantee that Fates will scratch the itch for more Fire Emblem. While it may not always do enough to differentiate itself from its legendary predecessor (even shamelessly aping some of its characters), it is a fantastic game in its own right that continues the upward trajectory that Awakening began for the Fire Emblem series."

*The story is a nonsensical journey strung together by one ""shocking"" revelation after another. Worse still, because this is seen as the golden route, Birthright and Conquest are effectively invalidated.
*Unit balance is a mess, ranging from flagrantly overpowered units like Ryoma or Xander, to lv.10 unpromoted units that can barely survive the maps they're recruited in, giving you little room for experimentation.
*The gimmicky level design and inconsistent enemy strength makes repeated playthroughs a chore"

As far as gameplay goes the thrill is the same as always, in my case I always choose classic mode to feel real tension in battle and to spice things up.

  ",8,"To be sure, there were some mild disappointments with regards to the closing entry in the Fire Emblem Fates series. First of all, I don't think the overall storyline needed to be told throughout three games- having just spent the last six months of my life playing Fire Emblem games, I ask myself if they were really all that different- Birthright and Revelation are so similar that I feel like I shouldn't have spent time on both. Second, I didn't like the way that you were able to get the entire roster of both games in this one game. Given that you're almost guaranteed to use all the royal families from both sides in this game, it means that you have very little room for anyone else in your party- so why even bother giving us these characters? I felt bad knowing that characters I liked from the prior games were just going to be entirely ignored during my playthrough. Not to mention, you spend several levels getting the crew from Birthright together before you even start on Conquest- I was hoping you would get some of each. Then, all at once, the entire Conquest crew joins you in a single level. It was dramatically imbalanced and was something of a shock to my roster. I did not like that. Third, the game's difficulty level is very skewed. The first few levels provide something of a challenge, but then I found myself hideously over-leveled by only the 4th or 5th level, and this was playing on Hard. I played a few of the Skirmish maps just to develop the relationships and weapon skills of some of my characters, but not to level up. Still, I found myself breezing through most of the game without a hitch until the very last level, when the only real challenge showed up. Even then, I beat it on my first try. So, the challenge of the game just isn't there.

With that said, I still really like the Fates franchise for the changes that it made to the game- I like the way they revamped the Support/Pair UP system, the way that they removed weapon durability in favor of having more diverse weapon options, the way that you collect and forge weapons and the introduction of ninjas and debuffs. I do not like how the reclass system does not reset your level, meaning that you would have to grind out gold to buy seals to increase your max level if you desired to obtain other special abilities or weapon proficiencies, and I didn't even bother with this feature. I also did not like many of the My Castle features, particularly levelling up Lilith (because it took a lot of unskippable time and didn't serve a purpose outside of the Invasion levels) and inviting others to your home (that also took a lot of unskippable time and offered only a minor bonus). I also didn't like that you accumulated lots of vegetables that you could never really put to good use, outside of buying outfits. That doesn't make any sense.

So, overall, I'm pleased with the franchise, but I wish they could've made the story worth being told across three games- then again, this is Fire Emblem. You're not here for the story- in which case, one game would have sufficed."

Revelation is a unique take on the story, and not as hard as Conquest, but it is still definitely worthy of your purchase and time. It expands and improves on everything in Awakening and keeps all the good stuff, exactly what a sequel in a long-running game series should do.

  ",5,"Fire emblem Fates revelations is the last of the three fates games to be realized in north America and is supposed to be a mix-up of the other two versions that ties up all loose ends to the stories. I personally am a huge fan of Conquest, having finished it four times and I have not played birthright since it was specifically described as an entry point to newcomers or fans who got into the series with the last entry thanks to the previous game, fire emblem awakening, but I have watched LPs of it. I have purchased revelations and am currently on the tail end of my second play through, and to put it bluntly, I find this game to be quite mediocre compared to both other versions and feel it was very rushed.

Revelation is a piece of DLC, which, in our day and age, is overused to the point it feels like the developers are pulling money from your wallet. To justify the existence of DLC, a game should be fully finished, which is somewhat the case for the other fates games, however their story has been intentionally cut and left out many explanations to justify this game's existence. Since this is the DLC game, it is almost guaranteed to be the last path played by the player, so it should therefore bring something fresh to the table. This is not the case at all, as for the first half of the game, the story is a blatant and lazy copy and paste from Birthright. The second half is excruciatingly repetitive to the point where the emotional moments lose all impact. The game also suffers from weak and generic villains who are completely stupid and act very unsubtle. This includes the main antagonist who has the exact same motivations as the villain from this game's predecessor and who's actual interesting backstory is locked between another paywall. The writing is otherwise bad and pays no attention to details, but I won't elaborate to avoid spoilers
Out of the three versions, Revelations has definitely the worst game play because of a sheer lack of play testing. It is still a tactical RPG like the other two versions but is significantly less enjoyable due to very bad gimmicks that will slow the game to a crawl in the second half and put terrible and tedious gimmicks in the first chapters. There is a severe lack of character balance, which makes about two thirds of the units fairly worthless unless the player ginds for hours on end. Finally, there is a chapter that does not function well at all, chapter 21, where the special gimmick gets screwed up and stops working, which is another example of how rushed and empty the game feels.
This game has the least exclusive content. It only has one unique character, Fuuga, and has only three new supports for each character. It has less unique chapters because this game has no unique paralogue levels. Other than that, the fact you receive units from both sides breaks the balance and allows for an extremely easy late game. This game was made to take more money from your pockets and because it exists, the other two versions have an intentional bad ending. You are better off spending your 20$ on another E-shop title, because this game brings little to the table and had no heart or soul put into it unlike its two sister games. It plays the worst, has the least content and you buying it will encourage Intelligent systems to pursuit such a despicable practice."

  ",1,"I am not happy to admit that I thoroughly loathe this game. NOW LISTEN- I adore the FE series my favorite being Blazing Sword (known as just Fire Emblem in USA). Which is why I despise this game. Every Fire Emblem game ads something new and meaningfull to the general gameplay of the series- refinements that have 0 downsides. For example- Sacred Stones started the trope of choosing multiple classes- much appreciated. But what does fates offer- the emphasis on player choice. Sounds cool right?It is. but in execution, this game falls flat on its face. selling hardly different endings for 3/4 the price of the game itself. Big mistake on all fronts. not to mention, the different versions offer nothing but different story, no gameplay improvements anywhere. speaking of gameplay, nothing has changed since awakening, meaning its good, but has gone nowhere, not to mention all models and textures are ripped from the last game, and results in this game being a cash grab with, copy-paste anime characters with no interesting characteristics, thus going against one of Fire Emblems concepts, new ,original, and developing characters (Hector for example). this game gets low ratings from me because im attatched to the traditional FE formula of being original and adding new, game- changing concepts. I dont want to hate this game, but in truth... it... *inhales*... ****."

  ",6,"First off, I want to start out by saying I'm a big Fire Emblem fan and that I enjoyed Birthright, Conquest, and awakening and would easily consider playing them again. In fact, the whole localization didn't bother me that much and I feel like they did a pretty decent job. Before you write me off or hate me, I have a very good reason behind the score I gave it. In a nutshell, Fire Emblem Fates: Revelations is a very boring game.

I'll admit that I stopped playing after chapter 19, but even getting through half the game and it being that much of a struggle is something in and of itself was pretty difficult to do after chapter 14, which is a middle finger for Conquest fans. Anyways, I'll give you my review on why I just couldn't finish this game and why it's almost not worth your 20 dollars.

[Warning this part of the review contains spoiler]

I'll start off with the story. The premise of the story is actually pretty good in chapter 7 since it decides to explain what's going on and kind of gives you a better idea of the main villain aka Anakos. It's weaker storywise than hidden truths, but it had potential. The deaths are just really stupid in this one, like really, really stupid (Conquest did two of the three deaths better) and it's just very poorly written. Before you point your finger to the treehouse, this is Intelligent Systems. It basically is just chapter 7 then filler to get all the characters...then chapter 7's exact story again in case you forgot it. Most of the Royals are 1-dimensional and they're really the only characters you see.

And I'm pretty sure everyone in their right mind can openly admit Izana's **** death can summarize the **** chapter. That reminds me that most of the plot twists are mind-numbingly obvious and that every boss pre chapter 24 is either a boss we fought before or just a generic enemy. I did skim for what happens after I stop and I will say that it looked cool and really good.

[End of Spoiler here]

Let's talk about the maps now. Fire Emblem was never really big on the main story so I often will forgive a bad plot for really cool and fun maps. Conquest and Birthright did have fun and enjoyable maps with the former having maps up to par with the Fire Emblem franchise. Conquest's maps aren't ""hard"" but they require more strategy to beat which is why I enjoyed that game. If you though anything Birthright threw at you was bad, Revelation somehow figured out a way to be worse than Birthright. Skirmish battles are more enjoyable.

I know one part of this hate for Revelation's maps is because I jumped out of Conquest which had excellent AI...like really, really good AI that I'd be excited to see in future installments. The AI in Revelations in the first half will suicide attack one of your units even if they only do no damage (Conquest enemies were smart and knew when to attack and even used skills to be cheap). Btw, you'll be lucky if an enemy even has a skill at all. The IS staff though it'd be super challenging if they used Promoted enemies instead. Other than a 1% crit, these tougher enemies are a complete joke.

Now you're looking at me and probably going ""So what, Birthright did a lot of that stuff too."" Well Birthright didn't reuse good maps and make them bad (which is another thing I'm bothered about). Birthright did however allow for a variety of characters to be used without the use of grinding. You could use almost any character and they'd be useful the whole game (bar a few exceptions) which made replayability a lot better. In revelations, 80% of the cast is just bad and shouldn't even be waster on experience for...including Effie and Niles.

Revelation was designed for all the Royals to be used, and Royals are OP which makes the game ridiculously easy. The fact that if your unit isn't promoted by 19 and doesn't have an attack over 32, you may as well pitch them as you can only bring 12 units, 10 of which will be royals. It's just a large barrier to use a character who's only half as good since almost all characters come in severely underleveled.

That's enough bashing on this path I'm not going to bother finishing. People who are into my castle and all that wireless stuff will definitely want to pick this one up due to having the full cast and giving children new skills. There are also some interesting support convos that can only be done in this poorly designed path. There's a few cool things in the campaign, but honestly I'd say save your money for any other FE game like Sacred Stones which has a much better plot.

And if you still think this is a 9 out of 10 game, there's a chapter where you have to slowly break ice blocks to reach the boss who doesn't move. Did I mention enemies drop stat boosting items like dracoshields?"

  ",9,"This game is just amazing! I have been a fan of Fire emblem since Sacred stones and I'm very happy with the approach Nintendo is taking with this one, I can´t stop playing the 3 versions, there's just a lot of content, so it's a great time to be a FE fan.

Many people are down voting the game because of the bad localization but don't let that to stop you from playing this game, let's be honest if you are playing Fire emblem just because you want to poke anime characters with your stylus then you are playing the wrong genre of game. Yes, sadly the localization is bad and the story is mediocre at best, Corrin is a very bland character, maybe the worst lord in FE games BUT everything else is amazing, the gameplay and the level design (even in Birthright) are a lot better than Awakening and that alone makes this an excellent game. The new characters, while not that memorable as they were in Awakening, are still very charming and likeable, the support conversations sometimes are great, sometimes not that good (mainly because of localization). The OST of the game is easily one of the best in all the saga and the voice acting is Ok, sometimes misses. By the way the few cutscenes of the game are gorgeous, the presentation in general is awesome and full of details.

The gameplay is the strongest point of the game, all the new systems that were broken in Awakening were greatly balanced in the game and the level design... I just love the level design, there's so much room for experimenting a lot of strategies, the difficult is just in the exact spot, even in lunatic it feels obviously very hard but fair and there are a lot of memorable levels that you're going to hate/love.

Now speaking of Revelations and all the DLC controversy, it's true this game isn't cheap but if you think that you're going to invest $80 dollars for the three campaigns and it's going to take you 100+ hours just to finish the stories, then it's totally worth it. There are others games that cost $90-100 dollars and takes 10-12 hours to finish them so there's no big deal here.

Don't forget also that FE let's you play the way you want, even in Conquest the ""hardest"" of the 3 you can play in casual mode if you are intimidated by the hardcore nature of the game or you can play Birthright in hard or lunatic and it's going to be a hardcore experience, so there's no excuse to enjoy Fates. Revelation is the most balanced version and it's very interesting seeing the interactions of all characters, being former enemies.

With all that said, Fire emblem fates is not a perfect game, it has big flaws but those flaws are outshined by what was done right, for me the worst wasn't the localization issues but the story, with a better writing this game could have been the greatest FE so far (still I love the silliness of some support conversations). Seriously, don't miss this game, there was a lot of love and work behind Fates, it's a gem of the genre and one of the best 3DS games so far, it holds a very special place in my collection."

  ",9,"TWO IMPORTANT THINGS:

Do not be put off by the user score, anti-censorship people are voting this down on purpose without finishing the game!

Do not buy this before playing at least one path!

Now that we got that outta the way, I'll share my thoughts on this path.

Revelations is the path where both Hoshido and Nohr come together; this has the largest amounts of units. Each chapter you'll be gaining like 2-3 units and eventually you will gain all the royal siblings as well. Brand new supports between Nohr and Hoshido units are in this route, making it very funny to watch them interact. All the royal siblings can also support with their opposite royal (e.g Camilla/Hinoka) which is very satisfying if you've played both routes.

This also has a lot of new maps with a lot of them having a gimmick; it's a defining feature of Revelation. Most of them are great but there's a few ones that make you very frustrated. It is quite different from Birthright which has simpler rout maps, so keep that in mind. Conquest players will be more in their element here.

The only negative thing I can say is that it is less bittersweet than the other two; there's a lot less death and the main theme of 'betrayal' is not really present once you get halfway through the game as everyone joins together in this path. Both Hoshido and Nohr have more dramatic/sad moments while Revelations is the golden path. However I'm sure some people would vastly prefer that and it was nice to see after playing two route with sad-ish endings.

Overall it's a 9/10 for me, there is a TON of content and units so you will be playing this for a while. :)"

  ",10,"The third route, Revelations, fits perfectly with Birthright and Conquest and does it's job of telling the true story of Fates. Wrapping up mysteries not solved in the other two versions. Bringing together the entire cast of characters and seeing certain Hoshido and Nohr characters interacting is one of my favorite parts of the game and it's made better by the infinite opportunities to build supports and train your units. The story is just as compelling as the other two versions and almost does the best job at **** you in, as I've found myself losing track of time while playing through the story to learn the mysteries each chapter offers. All in all, I'm gonna say Revelations is my favorite route of the three and does a great job of telling the whole story of the games."

  ",6,"Compre el Fates SE y puedo decir,
Fates es como el universo marvel, la historia real es Revelation, mientras que Conquest y Birthright son los universos de ""What if"" cada uno con sus cosas buenas y malas.
El juego debió solo ser Revelation y como packs de DLC's Conquest y Birthright para conocer como pudo ser, semejante al ""The Future Past"" pack en Awakening.

Pros
- Tienes todas las armas y equipos
- Exponencial cantidad de conversaciones

Contra
- Censura y retirada de contenido, acá no encontraras lo perdido en los otros dos, mala localización y modificación de conversaciones como todas las relaciones S de Kana y podrás reirte del meme que volvieron la conversación de SaizoxBeruka

De todas maneras la ruta es superior a las otras dos, pero los 3 juntos no forman un juego lastimosamente y solo son $80 de relleno de un juego de $40 que no se entrego. Hubiera sido mejor al finalizar un juego sufrir de un sentido de perdida y tener la opción de regresar en el tiempo para hacerlo esta vez bien en un NG+.

Nintendo ademas tiene problemas serios en la treehouse que esta erosionando su antigua y fiel fanbase con contenido correcto por algunos Social Justice Warriors."

  ",10,"For me, this isn't a 10. It's a 9.5

As it stands, of the three iterations, Revelation is the one that most closely resembles Awakening, as it brings together every character, weapon, item and mechanic from both versions. This makes for some great support conversations, more customization, and it helps expand the long term value of the game by a lot.

While most reviewers agree that Revelation stands in the middle ground when it comes to difficulty, I have to disagree. I think Revelation might just be the easiest of three, for the most part, not entirely. I'd say for newcomers, hard difficulty might be a pretty viable option. For hardcore players, I'd say lunatic on your first run might pretty doable, more than Birthright, and definitely more than Conquest.

It may not offer a story as epic as Conquest, but it does present us with its unique take on the story, more characterization, new villains, and some pretty impressive twists. My only negative would be that by the end of the game, the maps start becoming a bit repetitive, but that's about it.

The censoring of the game did bother me, but I'm not about to dock off points unfairly for such a great game.

TL;DR If you liked Conquest or Birthright, go buy this one. Now"
