  ",8,"I highly recommend playing this game in a way that allows you to speed through some of the slower parts of it (i.e. the beginning, grinding levels and other more tedious aspects of gameplay). If played on original hardware, I'd rate this game a 6/10 by modern standards, because it (and other Pokémon games) are unbelievably slow. However, when sped up, I would put this game at a 9/10.

Black 2 is one of the best experiences I've ever had with a Pokémon game. It cuts out a lot of the tedium of the other games, and while there are still many very slow moments, increasing the speed of the game can turn a frustratingly slow experience into one that I believe Pokémon should be. Having said that, I cannot recommend playing Black 2 in its original incarnation due to the absurdly slow pace of battles and annoying moments of ""filler"" (i.e. story events and excessive dialogue)."

There are a lot of underrated new Pokemon, and while some are stinkers, that is to be expected; however, the setting and characters help drive the story forward, and the music pushes it that much more. For what it is as a Pokemon game, it appears as this is the game in which Game Freak cared about making the most, and the one they decided needed to turn out well. I would highly recommend this game as well as its prequels."

The 2D sprite animations will never get old as opposed to when the series decided to become 3D. Tons of after story stuff to do and tons of pokemon to find to fill the pokedex. I always recommend this version to anyone who has a DS or 3DS as one of the must play pokemon games to this day.

- Explorig the Unova region a second time but now with more pokémons to encounter.
- Some parts of the map have evolved due to the 2 years between the two episodes plots.
- 3 new Gym Leaders and a new Champion to keep refreshed. And the old ones have updated their gyms.
- A perfect story thanks to the antagonist's personality.
- This generation introduced the Shiny Charm, great for shiny hunters when the base rate is at 1/8192.

These games may be 10 years old but it's still time to discover them !"

  ",7,"Solid game but in retrospect it's overrated. While Generation 5 comes with a lot of PvE battling content, it's ultimate quantity over quality as there's so much that held it back from its full potential.  For one, the story is not so great, as the only real direction in narrative was to show Team Plasma off as terrorists. We needed this game to be about Kyurem. We needed the Unova sequels to flesh out further on Unova lore and try its best to complete it all the way. In the end, in 2023, Zygarde got more fleshed out without ever having a game than Kyurem did with two games. Kyurem is also still one of the most misunderstood Pokemon to this very day. Black 2 White 2 are good games, they just aren't good sequels. The fact many people are ""optimistic about waiting for Unova remakes to complete the set altogether"" expresses part of my point. These SHOULD HAVE been the games to give Unova a proper conclusion. We shouldn't have to wait for remakes to come out in an era where Pokemon probably doesn't care anymore. As we've been with BDSP and Scarlet and Violet, I don't even have faith in Unova remakes to be any good anymore.

Another point I have to make is the content itself. The standout features here are the Battle Subway, the PWT, the Pokestar Studios, the White Treehallow, and the Black Tower. While Generation 5 has a lot of content catering to one aspect of the game, it's not necessarily diverse. This game lacks the external features many other generations have. They have nothing like the Pokeathalon, the Poke Amie, Super Training, the Poke Pelago, Pokemon Contests, or anything where you can really see your Pokemon in a different light and get to connect with them more. They have musicals but that's just watching your Pokemon dance for 1 minute after dressing them up, and it's not necessarily anywhere near the levels of the fleshed out content other Pokemon games have.

The battles themselves aren't the best of quality in Gen 5, as the critical health theme legitimately holds the quality of each match hostage, and the most you're getting out of these games are repetitive cycles of restricted Champion teams. I remember when playing as a kid, feeling frustrated by how held back the AI trainers were in games as late as Gen 5. Unlike with the 3DS games, there's not really a way for you to get a full 6v6 battle against level 100s at all unless you battled friends in real life. Even then, the overall battle mechanics are much better in the 3DS games, as you don't have to deal with endless weather strategies, sleep counter resets, copycat roar, Sky Drop glitch, etc. It gets boring after battling Cynthia and her level 78 Garchomp all the time for example, without her ever keeping up with my level 100s and legendaries. The 3DS offered a tool within those games to greatly help with this in the Vs. Recorder, an overlooked feature that's essentially a sandbox for how you could set up battles for your game. I can hardly care about facing off against repetitive Champion teams in the overworld or in PWT when I can get so much more off later generations of Pokemon games overall, and with better battling mechanics.

Black 2 White 2 are also the most money-hungry main series Pokemon games before the Nintendo Switch. Do I even have to explain? They installed a key system, which made the difficulty setting version exclusive. Challenge Mode is exclusive to completed Black 2 saves, Easy Mode is exclusive to completed White 2 saves. If you wanted to Challenge Mode to White 2 you will need to link with a completed Black 2 save. This resets upon resetting the save file. The White Treehallow and the Black Tower were also version exclusive. Many people overlook the severity of this in particular. The White Treehallow had Breeders who often carried Chansey and Blissey, making it the most efficient method of grinding levels in the 2D era of Pokemon games. The Black Tower did not have this, because they made the EV distributions of trainers you fought in Black Tower/White Treehallow version exclusive.(HP/Atk/Def - White Treehallow) (SpA/Spe/Spe - Black Tower). Both the difficulty setting and most efficient grinding methods were version exclusive. You were also required to have Black or White to access unique content via Memory Link, and were required to have Gen 4 games for National Dex completion. Black 2 White 2 are certainly not worth the high price they sell for second-hand today when they're tied in these chains.

Lastly, I have no clue why people call these the most replayable Pokemon games. The story is lackluster and flooded with missed opportunities, and you lose so much off resetting them. You lose PWT progress (which was annoying to get back, and if you downloaded PWT content, it's now gone forever), you lose Pokestar Studios progress, you lose Medal progress (which you can now never complete), you lose the keys, and you lose Join Avenue progress. All the best things about B2W2 require not resetting them."

  ",5,"UPDATE
Pokémon Black 2 doesn't have a story as thematically rich and thought-provoking as its prequel's, but it's far from bad as it makes the most of its sequel nature, diving deeper into old characters and ideas and taking them in new directions, whilst also introducing a couple of new interesting plotlines. Gameplay-wise, the new PokéStar Studios facility is the endearing side-activity that Musicals failed to be, offering a really fun diversion and hours of hilarious cheesy dialogue, but the real gem of the experience is most definitely the Pokémon World Tournament. Acting both as an incredible treat for hardcore players looking for a challenge and a fanservice bomb, the World Tournament allows us to meet and fight every single Gym Leader and Champion from the entire series with remixed tracks and new teams in a variety of battle modes. It is undoubtably the richest battle-focused postgame content in the history of the main series. A beautiful way to celebrate and end the 2D era of the franchise."

  ",10,"Knowing that the Unova sequels came from a time where the franchise reached a low point in popularity makes me yearn for another period of such. More and more the modern games expand on questionable features at the behest franchise staples to cater to the average consumer. Pokémon Black and White 2 are games that were made for the hardcore Pokémon fans during a time in which the franchises popularity had reached a low point before the 3D boom. As such a lot of the features, the story, and hell even the side content requires context you might not have if you haven't played all of the other games. If you are new to Pokémon skip this game and come back when you've played all the others, the time you put into the rest of the franchise only ripens this game further and makes it taste that much sweeter when you play through it.

While there isn't an insane amount of new content compared to it's predecessor, there is still quite enough here to make the second romp around Unova feel fresh and interesting. From new locations to revamped old ones they tried to take what was there and twist it  just enough that you don't feel like you're playing the same game.

In short, this game gets better and better the more Pokémon games you have played prior."

  ",10,"These games are the most fun you can have on a DS! The campaign is a blast from start to finish, offering a decent challenge with memorable characters and a great plot. Couple that with the versatile regional dex, and you have a Pokemon experience like no other.

If you enjoyed the original Black/White, then the sequels are even more of a must-buy. The story from the originals is excellently expanded upon here, and the new Unova region is very refreshing. There are also many new features and minigames to keep you engaged long after you finish the story, like Hidden Grottos, Pokestar Studios, the PWT, and lots of neat little events with NPCs.

To put it simply, Pokemon Black 2/White 2 are masterful games with an insanely good soundtrack, beautiful visuals, great story, and loads of content. It really doesn't get much better than this."

This game has everything that each RPG needs, but ok, let´s go step by step:
- The game starts as every other game from previous generations, you receive your starter, you meet your rival, you are taught how to catch pokemon and a large list of things you do during the first hour. The game could be that boring and unnecessary third version, but no, here comes what this saga needs: a sequel of the previous game.
As I was playing I found out that this time in Unova things were different: Pokemons from other regions are obtainable, new towns/cities and gym leaders, and a complete new plot for the game. I was afraid that the game turn out to be boring and my surprise was that each step that I took during the adventure,  it turned into a complete new experience. The new locations were fresh, charismatic, beautiful and what can I say about the OST? That is one of the best soundtracks we ever had.
For a long time since diamond and pearl, I lost my interest on Pokemon games, but playing this game made me feel as in the old days when I spent hours playing in Johto or Kanto.
The post game offers the challenge mode, fights with gym leaders and champions from other regions, legendary pokemon from other games and more and more things to do.

On one hand, it's essentially just DLC for Black and White. But on the other, it's a little bit more. There's new areas of Unova to discover, the Pokemon World Tournament, and places you might've skipped beforehand that may have a little surprise in the post-game.
I would say this game kind of sets the bar for Pokemon games. Black and White were some of the best games in the series, and the sequels only improve on them."

Seriously, the sequel concept is so much better than the typical third versions with how you really get to see how the characters and region change over time. There are plenty of new faces and locales to see, as well as cool new features and mechanics like the Join Avenue, Pokestar Studios, Medal collecting, and a vast postgame with a facility that's fan service galore.
The only bad things i can really say about these Pokemon games is that the story was a little weak and had some pacing issues. The overall package is just so polished and rich, and it's a shame they don't make them like they used to."

You have to play and beaten the first Pokemon Black or White so the story here all makes since but I felt you dont really need to play the first but it helps. Its like watching Avengers: Age of Ultron when you didn't even watch the 2012 Avengers so you have no idea how the heroes came together.

Based on 7 year old memory
-Story is good, not great like the first Black and White
-Pokemon Graphics at 2012 DS standards were leaps and bounds ahead of what Diamond and Pearl had to offer. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl felt stiff.
- New Team Plasma isn't as good as N's Team Plasma which in my opinion, N's Team Plasma had the best reason for world domination out of every other team.
- Protagonist characters look the best in the franchise but thats subjective so.

  ",9,"Even though there is a lot to talk about this game, I'll try to keep it short.

Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 are both a massive expansion and a substantial improvement to the already good Black and White versions, as well as great games on their own.

Everything you may expect from a core Pokemon game released by 2012 is present in those games, and nothing is poorly handled either. The story is engaging, yet not overwhelming, the region is more expansive than in the previous entries and packed with fantastic route designs, the Pokemon selection includes over 250 Pokemon species available in the main game, the level curve is arguably the best one out of all the core games to this day (no big spikes and always coherent), there are intuitive grinding methods and the soundtrack is both memorable and expansive (about 300 tracks coded in).

However, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 also largely surpassed expectations. While they still retain everything that was was added in Pokemon Black and White versions, such as phenomena (rustling grass, dust clouds, etc.) and Pass Powers, they added many unique features, such as the PokeStar Studios and the PWT. Minor but appreciated changes to gameplay were also made for those games, such as the ability to use Repels continuously and the reintroduction of the ability to multi select Pokemon in your PC boxes.

On top of that, those games definitely have their own charm: not only are certain characters only present in them, they also sport some extra region elements such as rematchable breeders and the fact that each of their Gyms has a unique track to it. As for the difficulty level, those games have no unfairly difficult battles, yet they have many challenging and thought-provoking ones (Elesa, Clay, Marlon, Ghetsis and Iris to name a few). The overall difficulty level is just right for most players, however there is an extra difficulty level called 'Challenge mode' for those who would be looking for a more challenging run of the games. There is also a good amount of post-game content, were some sidequests are available to the player, as well as more areas of the region and many legendary Pokemon, most of them being from previous entries of the series. Finally, the battle engine is essentially the same as that of Black and White versions, therefore it is arguably the fastest one out of the series, making for fast battle action and minimal battle delays.

In my opinion, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 are Pokemon games it's hard not to eventually regret skipping over. And if you happen to do so, the only solution is to play them and to see for yourself what makes those Pokemon games great."

  ",8,"Pokemon Black Version 2 is the Pokemon game that was the transition game between the DS and the 3DS, it was created in 2012 and with the new console on its way it was only natural for the next new game to be the best in the DS line up from a graphical standpoint. Areas like Castelia City are proof of this alone, but this game shows off more through it's animated cut scenes, which, while sometimes clunky, keep the pace for the rest of the game. The story of this game is a massive improvement in the context of the Pokemon games, however, when compared to the original black and white games, it only moves slightly forward, but just enough to the point where it is a new and different experience. As for the Pokemon additions, it keeps most of the Pokemon from black and white until the post game with a few exceptions including the new legendary. Overall, this Pokemon game was good for what it was, a transition game. It does have minor flaws which I have mentioned within this review and is what keeps it from a 9 or 10 spot. However I had a great experience with this game and I would not dissuade you from checking this game out."

Oh yeah, because it isn't like Generation One Pokemon were based off of food or slud- Oh hi Exeggcute and Muk!
Anyways, the game was the last Pokemon game to use 2D sprites instead of 3D sprites, and I loved it for that. But there's more, the starter designs, besides Emboar, were some of the best. The most common criticism of this game is that it's a carbon copy of Black and White 1. To that I say: That is completely wrong. There's a very different story, different main legendary, different evil team (sort of), more Pokemon around and so much more. The game play has refined so much since Red and Blue (The worst of the series BTW), but I think this is my favourite in terms of looks, flair and many other things as well. To end my review, I'm gonna quote the immortal words of Fawful's Minion: ""The world pointed to the three main colours as the ingredients for the finest art, but without black ink and a white canvas, how much art can you really make?"""

The new Pokemon are as always welcomed to the franchise, but actually there is not much here, just black and white kyurem, keldeo, genesect, and another one that i forgot (you could get the last three in the last games by hacking it with all the move sets so this is also another ""Disk Locked Content"")

The new cities and places are my favorite edition to the game, they make unova a whole lot greater

  ",9,"I think that is game is a solid improvement from its predecessor Pokemon Black. In the short two years, there have been lots of changes, and if you are looking for a new experience, you will not be disappointed. The story is remarkably different, yet just as interesting, if not more so than the story in Pokemon Black, with new Pokemon, cities and towns, routes, important characters, Gym Leaders, and more. Many of the music tracks from the previous installment have been changed and enhanced, and of course there are new tracks that complement the environment, scenery, and Pokemon battles. Honestly, Game Freak should be commended for actually significantly changing the game this time around in comparison to Pokemon games of the past where the final version merely has minor differences here and there.

That said, however, perhaps too much has been added or changed from the previous installment. There seems to have been some sort of attempt to deviate from the linearity of Pokemon Black, which is understandable, but the game has become too 'non-linear'; there is content literally everywhere and it soon becomes a burden-of-knowledge scenario. Of course, this could be dismissed and the abundance of content would have been a huge plus if the story-line was less strict and more adventurous like an open world, but since the story-line and sequence of the game is so strict, as if to make the game easy for kids (ugh, this generation of kids is bad at video games), you find yourself in the paradox of overly-linear gameplay, and yet an open and plentiful region. Similarly, the Pokedex has expanded almost too much; by including Pokemon en masse from every other region, the Pokemon from the native region have become respectively less unique, making the Pokedex more generic, and its size contributes to the burden-of-knowledge as well - again, a more open world would have remedied this and easily turned it into a bonus, considering the nature of the region itself.

All in all, I feel that much of the adventurous potential has gone to waste, but regardless, these problems are not nearly enough to avoid an enhanced, thoughtful, story-driven, and thus worthy edition to the franchise."

You can get more pokemon in-game than you could with the first black/white, but they still expect you to use the stupid dream world for the rest of them, which is an online flash minigame thing that's mostly dumb.

[Part 1] part one is about battle actions, glitches and bad looking Pokémon.

If you like Pokémon B.W. you might not like Pokémon Black and White 2.This version isn’t a big improvement. While there are two new forms for Kyurem [Pokémon] it looks dangerous and ugly. In the game the images are the same as in Black and White.
Some Pokémon battle actions [where they move or look stupid] look like they died. Charizard’s battle action is the worst. In the original games Charizard could never bend his neck but in Black and White 2 his neck is always bent. Why did they ruin it?
There are a lot of glitches in Pokémon Black and White 2 like Dodrio [normal and flying type Pokémon]. The game allows you to teach it the H.M. [hidden move] Fly which allows you to fly to places you’ve been.
Dodrio does not have wings and three heads I mean like how does it fly? It’s stupid! Another glitch is Ghost girl. I’m not sure if she’s a glitch, she is a question in the game.  If she is not a glitch she is a question left unanswered. No one knows what she is supposed to be for.

While I do admit Black and Whitete 1 were kind of a let down compared to the rest of the series, I simply cannot say the same for Black and White 2. Let's face it, the Unova region was a line in the first versions. However, in Black and White 2, the Unova region has more twists and turns and routes while still clinging to its hexagonal roots. Hidden Grottoes were a way more fun way to get hidden ability pokemon compared to the somewhat tedious act of having to transfer them from your computer. Join Avenue was a really cool addition seeing that you could customize your shops to your liking. The key system is awesome seeing that you could either up the challenge or lower it. The story is very interesting seeing that it's a direct sequel to Black and White 1 and while you don't need to have played the first ones to understand the story, you'd certainly get more out of it. The Unova region finally has obtainable pokemon from other generations before the Pokémon League, something its predecessors lacked. And while I could go on listing things I like about for a while, let's get to what they got wrong. Honestly there isn't much they got wrong this time around. Other than the still stupid AI even in Challenge mode, and the return of the infamous C-Gear, there isn't anything really I have to complain about; except Garbordor. You really messed up there. While it still clings to its roots and the title alone seems like it'll be a rip off, you'll find something in here that you love, whether you're returning from Black and White or just starting out. It isn't perfect, but it's sure a rerun worth more than what you'd paid for it. I give this game a 9.5/10"

Team Plasma is more intimidating this time, most likely due to them ditching the original ridiculous outfits for a more ninja appearance which looks great! The region is a lot different because you start on the opposite side of the region. You can trade right from the start which I liked, as you had to beat the game before you could trade in the first games, but it was a nice challenge not to trade.

The post-game content is better than ever, the music is just as awesome (if not better), but it did feel more like Black and white 2.0 rather than Black and White 2 (if ya get what I am saying).

But besides that this is still a great game (9 out of 10), and I recommend this game to almost everyone."

Unlike ""Pokemon Platinum"", players are able to experience its region in a different time period, thus, enabling new technology and the areas explored in the first game, being entirely redecorated. Although the Unova region may feel old and tedious at times, ""Pokemon Black Version 2"" has enough new and interesting qualities to make it feel enjoyable."

  ",10,"I have played Gold, Ruby, Platinum, HeartGold and Black before, and to compare, this game got replay value. Lots of it. If you're ever going to play it, do it now while the Pokemon Global Link is supporting the game. Yes, the Pokemon Dream World is quite childish, but if you just ignore that, you have LOTS of available pokemon, without even trading. Probably the most of any game in the series. When you get through the game, Join Avenue is probably the best thing that has happened to the game. The grind to hatch eggs, happiness, EVs and levels are probably the reasons why most people won't bother trying to get the perfect pokemon. Getting money isn't difficult at all, as you can trade (easily with other players) and plant ultra rare berries in the Dream World, and earn about 600K per day when you get your first stack. Not even that, you can use Join Avenue to get lots of money with the treasure shop. But enough about that. When you get through the game, you can unlock different modes, which differs from Black 2 and White 2, Easy and Challenge mode in addition to the normal game. Black 2 got Challenge mode, which is probably the only thing you want, as most people would like the game to be a tiny bit more challenging. Yes, Black 2 is the easiest game in the series. Easily. But, it's better that it's too easy, than too difficult, as there are lots of rules you can set in your mind to make it challenging. So it's just good that the game becomes easy for the casual players, but can still be challenging for the veterans. And the 5th gen got the best legendaries since 2nd gen. To end, this is by far the best pokemon game in terms of gameplay. Though I hate those foongus..."

  ",8,"At my age I thought Pokémon was a dying franchise, and was still cramming down as many games and T.V shows; I still think the shows should've stop. With the release of the newest generation of Pokémon I was not interested in buying this game, but I eventually succumbed to curiosity and purchased Pokémon white. I thought that was one of the best ones ever, the gameplay, the strategy, it was a great experience. When I heard shortly after the release of the first one the was another one coming out: Black & White 2. I thought it was too soon for another one, but I ended up getting it anyways. So I thought it would be another version of the same game but with minor differences. In a way it kind of was, but in another way it improves in many other factors. Like the story has improved, and is more interesting, but like the previous games it just comes and goes. There's actually no giant significant difference from its previous instllment, it's actually the little things that makes this game a bit better. That's what I think of this game: It's a little bit better."

The game is easy enough to be welcoming, perhaps too much so for my taste, but there are always ways to make the game harder for yourself.  Story does not win any medal though which is a shame because there is so much potential for a good narrative (read Pokemon Adventures).

Any faults in the original Black and White were fixed, story that was left unclear was cleaned up, Move Tutors, more areas to the Unova Region and anything you were expecting from Black and White will most likely have it. Also, intermixing different region Pokemon is back. Awesome."

  ",10,"When this game was announced in March of 2012 with Black and White Kyurem also being announced, I thought to myself "" Yes, a new Pokémon game, but still in Unova?"" Yes, I knew about the third game thing Nintendo and Game Freak do with the franchise. As the game released in Japan and I watched many walkthroughs of it to see what I could expect, my excitement kept falling and falling. Until Christmas Day, when I got the game and I gave it a shot. I love Unova two years later because it is SOOOOO pretty and you will be seeing a lot of familiar faces. The amount of Pokémon in the game is very helpful than the first. While there was only 150 Pokémon in the first game's Unova Pokédex, the number has doubled in this game, bringing it up to 300. Some of these Pokémon include Riolu, Eevee and Trapinch. You can also get a Zorua in game without going to an event and that Zorua is a very special Zorua indeed. Also, the conflict between the Team Plasma of past and present is very interesting to watch at how N and Ghetsis rule each of their teams. And its the little things to that make this game brilliant. Asking to spray a Repel when your previous one has run out without going into your bag. The animations of Trainers. The amount of good training spots, which is something all Pokémon Trainers will appreciate. Tons of replay value. I was fighting a Clefable just a while ago, it used Metronome and it said "" Wagging a finger let the foe's Clefable use..."" These are the little things that make this game so great. But with great advantages comes some disadvantages. Some of the boss battles, like Gym Leaders, are too easy. Like Ghetsis in the last game WAY overpowered but in this game, his Pokémon are easy to take out and fighting his Hydreigon is just not as scary as it was in the first game. And at the beginning, there is a HUGE tutorial on the basics, which are not to be told to experienced Trainers but is useful for beginners. Like, I got asked how to open a bag, for God sake! But these are only little things. All in all, this is a great game and a huge improvement on the first game and the best Pokémon game I have played, mabye the best one yet!"

Some of the new features are nice and it has a good selection of mons, so it would have worked much better as the usual 'third version'. As it stands you have to deal with the atrocious plot.

This is the only pokemon game I've ever regretted buying."

Pros: Pokemon from previous generations are made available throughout the game; Zorua is easily attainable; Wi-Fi connectivity offers a ton of multiplayer value; one of the most visually delightful Pokemon games to date.

  ",9,"In short, it improves upon everything that was introduced in B/W 1. With all new zones, a wider Pokemon roster, more attention to detail and generally so much more to do, once you go B/W 2, you'll never want to go back. Arguably the best game in my opinion since the original Gold/Silver. The only qualms I have with this particular entry is the plot, which went out with a whimper, unlike the original's fantastic climax. Which is a shame, considering they got everything else just right.

It is rather sad, however, as this will be the last G5 game, seeing as Game Freak will probably head off to do a remake of Sapphire/Ruby for the DS, before finally moving to the 3DS. By then, maybe fans will finally get the definitive Pokemon game to rule them all."

  ",10,"Pokemon Black and White 2 are one of the best entries in the series so far. There are a mixture of small and big changes, but all make the game feel fresh. The simple inclusion of pre-Unova Pokemon and new starting towns helps the starting zone feel new and exciting. While I generally preferred the story in Black and White, the journey to the Elite Four I found much more enjoyable in Black and White 2. Other additions include the Pokestar Studios (a film making ""minigame"", that is very enjoyable), Join Avenue (sort of like a customizable mall) and Pokemon World Tournament (which allows you to battle past Gym Leaders and Champions). The Memory Link was also a clever feature, allowing players who have completed Black and White to get new pieces of story in the two year gap.  If you liked any of the Pokemon games at all, you'll like this one."

You start with the same starter Pokemon from Black and White and build up it stats all over again. What I would have liked to see is that you pick all of the starters Pokemon from all the regions such as Bulbasaur or Charmander. When a new Pokemon game comes out for the 3DS GameFreak needs to totally rebuild this series from top to bottom.

  ",10,"The recent release of Pocket Monsters Black Version 2 and Pocket Monsters White Version 2 in Japan was a pre-empted shock to those outside the world of Pokémon. Along with the summer arrival came the remorse (as its similarity to HeartGold and SoulSilver, themselves remakes, is striking) of the previous games. Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 are set two years after the fall of N and Team Plasma, with characters, concepts, and Pokémon never before seen. The story takes place at the same region, Unova, but with a different rival. Also, one of the rivals from the previous game, Cheren, is now a Gym Leader.

These games also have a new facility known as the Pokémon World Tournament. Not only does this feature allow players to battle every gym leader, as well as champion, from every region (with the exclusion of Koga), but it also changes the battle theme for each opponent they face, upgrading them from memories lost to memories regained, and transforms the game itself into a battle-field fit for all players of all genders and generations, making for a never-ending TRUE Pokémon battle between masters!"

  ",9,"Pokemon BW2 is an excellent game. With new characters, new music, new locations, ""new"" pokemon (pokemon from previous generations, unlike the Unova-specific preE4 roster from BW) and a new plot, it's quite fun. All locations have changed in some way or another, whether it's adding new buildings/gyms, to revamping cities, to completely new cities, and it's nice to see how it had developed over the two years (in addition, the cities and towns are the largest yet). Another neat thing to notice are the gyms - what they lost in complexity (which was a bit disappointing), they gained in originality and character. Each gym has its own exclusive track (from Elesa's fabulous ""Are you ready?"" electronic theme, to Burgh's cool, creepy (and by far my favorite) one)), and have great setup. Gamefreak also added in tons of things to keep you busy, whether it's collecting the 200+ medals (the equivalent of achievements or trophies), to making movies in Pokestar studios, to playing Funfest Missions, challenging the towers in White Forest/Black City, and finally challenging the top trainers in the World Tournament. Of course, some of the features from BW return in this game, such as the Musical Contests and the Battle Subway. Along with the large features, Pokemon BW2 really shines in the details. Tiny things, like sunbeams shining whenever you come out of a building, to moving NPC sprites (finally!), to the ""battle platforms"" for your Pokemon (simple coloured circles, be gone! Depending on your location, you can get grass gently blowing in the wind, to rippling waves, etc.) all add a sense of pleasure and detail to your playthrough that had never been seen before (at least, it does for me - I love small details like that). New Hidden Hollows, areas where you can catch Pokemon with their hidden abilities, are also a joy to discover. There are a couple of downsides to BW2, however - first of all, because the selection of Pokemon at the beginning is so varied and, well, good, I found the playthrough to be a bit easy compared to previous games. I have not yet touched the Challenge Key, but that will hopefully solve the difficulty curve once I acquire it (still, the wide variety of Pokemon can offer you different gameplays, if you are one to plan your team ahead of time). Another thing that really bothered me was the dialogue and general plot progression. It's so incredibly clunky and badly written that I found myself wincing more than once (and even at one point believing that my game had miraculously become bootleg). As some people have mentioned, it isn't as 'fresh' as BW - but do you honestly expect it to be? Keep in mind, this is the equivalent of Platinum, or Emerald - it's leagues ahead of any Grey version we might have gotten, and all of the changes still ignite the feeling of exploration, albeit not as much (and please don't complain about there not being any new Pokemon - this is not a new generation!) Still, this game is another incredibly fun romp through the land of Unova. The upsides greatly outweigh the downsides of this game, which are minuscule (with exception of that dialogue! What happened to you, translation team?) I fully recommend that you get it. Why not?"

  ",8,"A game that packs more punch than it would appear on the surface. For the first time in franchise's history, the traditional ""third version"" feels like an actual new adventure instead of the same experience repackaged. For starters, the dex got massively expanded - a whopping 150 Pokemon (more than ever before) were added to the Unova Pokedex, including fan-favourites such as Growlithe and Eevee. Picking your final 6 of such a massive collection is nothing short of a challenge, and greatly contributes to the series already excellent replayability. The way you progress through the map is also very different -  several new zones were added, and on top of that, each of the old zones got nicely redesigned, making them feel fresh. The game is also feels a bit less linear than BW - there are more caves, hidden secrets, more non-obligatory routes and places (like a haunted house). However, several problems, some of which were present in BW1, still remain unsolved. Musicals only ""advantage"" is that you're not forced to play them this time around. The hyped Pokemon World Tournament is frankly a poor man's Battle Frontier - no amount of fanservice is going to hide the fact that it's a compilation of easy, boring battles that any half-competent player will breeze through in 10 minutes tops. Online service is still mediocre at best - Dream World should only be played by total masochists, Random Match-ups are marred by disconnectors and cheaters, while Global trade station still allows for ridiculous things such as the famed lv.9 Reshiram (not legally obtainable by any means!). Despite this, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 remain a great addition to the DS collection, and a game that hopefully all future ""third versions"" will follow suit."
