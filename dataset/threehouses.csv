  ",8,"It's a good game, but not good enough to give it a 9 or 10. The game has some annoying issues that were less present in previous Fire Emblem games, such as the design of the battle maps and the unbalanced difficulty level. Additionally, the side activities in the game are very boring, especially the side quests, whether it's in their execution or their stories. Overall, the side activities are repetitive throughout the game and are not interesting or motivating enough to complete. On the other hand, the story and characters were not up to par in the first half of the game, but there was a significant improvement in the second half. The truth is, the story and characters in the game are its biggest positives. While the combat is enjoyable, it lacks challenge, and the design of the battle maps does not encourage strategic thinking and planning."

Its sytems lead to a very satisfying loop that keeps you hooked at least one house in and more beyond. It sucessfully makes multiple battes and units feel impactful and causes tons of varied conversation of main antagonist and plot, leaving an impact. Whole im sure older games with weapon triangle have more to battle systems, this game stands out for its character social link like systems making every character feel important and involved and this doubles when theydo well in combat rewarding the players efforts really well. The music is amazing just amazing. Wow. This game is SO good!"

Game is an appropriate challenge on Maddening, very difficult and requires some planning, but not unfair. I deduct one point because the game occasionally rewards grinding, such as fishing providing prof exp. Also not a big fan of tea parties rewarding you with charm, since they become important later on and are incredibly random and boring."

The story was pretty neat? I'd give the story an 8, didn't really like how some characters just die off-screen, the gameplay is not as satisfying as Awakening or Fates but it's still very enjoyable due to the fact that everyone can just use whatever I want them to. Oh and when you had to choose to go to battle, it was only worth it when it was a paralogue because it had story and the maps were fairly different, the ones with ""rare monsters"" who just give you a rusted weapon and it turns out it's a silver weapon and the other normal ones were honestly a waste of time in part 2."

Some of these are more welcome than others; the main thing to understand is that you will have significantly more downtime in the game in comparison to other Fire Emblem games. One of my biggest complaints is the lack of diversity for the highest levels of character classes - seemingly all of them are horse-riding, lance-wielding tanks or spell-casters. Not a lot of options for swords-wielders, axe-wielders, pegasus knights, or archers, etc."

  ",7,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the best in terms of character design and world-building. However, The gameplay has a lot of things to offer and plummet the challenge in tactical games.
The best feature I love in this game is roster building, where all your main rosters will be immediately available from early chapters and you can recruit another one optionally. This feature gives you the freedom to build your skills to your favorite characters as much as you plan in the early game.
However, I found out that they give too many utility skills, and gambits in this game, especially the foresight line that lets you know how enemies will attack you are really breaking the game, combined with how AI is dumb. All of this makes the game too easy.
Speaking of value this game is really great, you can play up to 200 hours with 3-4 playthroughs to know everything in the game. However, I found out that after I cleared the first house, it was really hard to replay in the second house, especially the first part which is almost the same, so I have mixed feelings about over content of this game.
Overall, I feel like this game is done well to balance between crew management and tactics game. However, I think it would be better if they nerfed some utilities in this game, and made the game more challenging. As well as make the first arc of the game more concise.

I personally give this 7 due to how our crews are OP and how AIs are dumb in gameplay..However, It still can be a weak 8 due to how contents they give us."

The game is bogged down by tedious new mechanics, an unintuitive method of completing quests/paralogues, and a headache-inducing academy to traverse at the end of every battle. The graphics are painfully average, with horrible sharpness to character portraits and very ugly-looking battle animations.

The story is compelling, and is easily the best writing in a Fire Emblem game. The cast of characters is top notch, with only a few duds. It also introduced the most controversial and talked-about lord in the entire series. So that must count for something.

The gameplay added new mechanics like battalions and monster battles, and removed some things that I really did not enjoy (like the weapon triangle). The class and tutoring system is flexible and gives you a lot of choice in how you build characters.

Speaking of which, New Game+, combined with this flexibility, gives the game a lot of replayability. Plus, there's multiple routes giving you ample reason to go back."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem Three Houses was everything I wanted in a game that I didn't know I did before I actually played it. It's the game I've put more hours in on Nintendo Switch and the one where every playthrough offered something fresh and my knowledge about the game was steadily improved. It also helped to steer away from internet guides and opinions about the characters and their intentions, as well as interpretations of the overall story. Almost every question will be answered by playing and exploring the game from all perspectives, and thinking over newly acquired knowledge. It was a personal journey to me, where I had my favorites, my least favorites, the ones I straight up disliked and a very small but meaningful pool of romantic interests. The characters/lore were extremely well written and thought out to accommodate broader notions than good/bad. The combat, well, it's Fire Emblem, so we are always in for one of the most fun and engaging battle systems in all of strategy rpgs. I'm a big fan of the series and even thought the game doesn't focus more on the combat side of things it never felt lacking in content. There's many battles to fight, places to go and people to see. Honestly, the biggest challenge about this game is letting it go, picking another game and moving on."

  ",2,"Worst Fire emblem experience ever and I’ve played revelations and **** romhacks

70% of the game is social sim filler, avoid at all cost unless you’re into that The gameplay is awful by FE standards, and for a strategy game the mechanics don’t add up to each other and most combat arts/gambits are irrelevant outside of them few busted ones. Forget about any difficulty higher than normal since hard is only hard in the 1/5 of the game and maddening is some random unfair **** because the dev are simply incapable. And all that isn’t mentionning bad map design and absolutely terrible balance People keep mentioning a good story but that’s just not true only 2/4 routes have good story and one of the good ones is a secret route which is unfinished and unpolished,The only good story you will probably get is White Clouds in the first half of the game before the route split afterwards the story is mediocre on paper but bad when you consider that gameplay/story dissonance is very high, it’s like the gameplay is trying to contradict the story at every possible occasion(ex: crest as a whole)

I’ve seen many claim that characters are at their best in the series but that’s just wrong many are insufferable and the practically all boil down to « I HAVE TRAUMA » also unlike any other FE you CANNOT just pick your favorites and have fun, you are stuck with who you got whether you like them or not. And sure you can recruit students but it’s too long, at the cost of training your main character and they join without any class mastery if not with terrible base stats for some adults

Im giving it a two and not a 0 because white clouds is still a great story even if I am absolutely disappointed every time I want to absolutely continue the story only to end up in the awfully long, boring and repetitive social sim part

Unit building is fun even it’s ultimately worthless to try to optimise your team since the difficulty will never hold up and the game is keen on never putting the player at any disadvantage (exactly how to NOT design a strategy game)

Three houses is an SRPG in a series of TRPG

I’ll reiterate my warning: avoid at all cost unless you’re into social sim and if you usually play FE for the gameplay"

Fire Emblem Three Houses is a wonderful game to play, Wii style 2007 graphics aside, to be fair, as is expected with most Switch games, this game was a blast. This game is everything we loved about the 3DS Fire Emblem Games, while not as good as them in my opinion, Intelligent Systems tried their best to modernize Fire Emblem. They tried to up the graphics, but they failed miserably, the open world aspect of the school and army fighting alongside the characters was a nice use of more powerful hardware. I chose Black Eagles, and up till a very specific point in the play through was splendid, however, unbeknownst to me, there was a very specific thing you had to do to get the Crimson Flower path, if you didn't know on your first play through like me, you were stuck with Silver Snow. While Silver Snow was fun, the final boss was absolute freaking horse **** Holy **** was that final boss was bad, they throw you against multiple different White Beasts which you have to beat to get to Rhea. This as a miserable, monotonous time and was a constant fight to keep playing, I got my ass handed to me on a silver platter the first time I fought them. I had to spend a couple hours grinding up with battles and building my team up to the task, this meanwhile I had no issues with previous missions. This was the most pathetic piss poor design of a final battle, having the final boss be leagues harder than previous missions, forcing you to grind up. After beating the final boss, the whole vibe was ruined for me, what felt like a strong, fun game became a chore to play because of this pathetic finale. Sleazy game design that forces you know what to do to get specific pathways are an abhorrent mess and should be abolished. Intelligent Systems, you failed to deliver, go back to the 3DS."

Worst is that if you are an old fire emblem fan, you will find the combat maps extremely uninspiring and uncreative. A lot of maps were flat with no restrictions and enemies were randomly scattered through the map.

  ",8,"Despite including somewhat barebones strategy mechanics, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the franchise’s true introduction to strategy RPGs with its multiple story paths and always-approachable character interactions.

FULL REVIEW:
Despite being one of Nintendo’s most famous franchises, the Fire Emblem titles have always lacked the player base to support them. Strategy RPGs are in a niche portion of the gaming industry. As such, many Fire Emblem titles went unlocalized in the NES and SNES era of Nintendo systems, and some of the franchise’s greatest titles went unnoticed despite Nintendo’s circulating popularity in the gaming industry. However, with the introduction of Fire Emblem: Awakening on the Nintendo 3DS, the series finally hit mainstream popularity. It’s known by now that the most accessible Fire Emblem games are the most successful due to a combination of gameplay and narrative. Awakening may have introduced the world to Fire Emblem, but Fire Emblem: Three Houses showed them how to love it.

There is one part of Three Houses everyone raves about: the campaigns. Four are available to players, depending on which house they pick at the game’s beginning and the connections they make throughout. War is a running theme in many Fire Emblem titles, but Three Houses is more approachable due to its substance. Its characters mature and grow as the game progresses, evident through a given character’s support level interactions. It helps players connect to several characters across all three houses, regardless of their depth or personality. In turn, players put their lives on the line against their enemies.

Speaking of enemies, the long-lasting turn-based strategy mechanics keep the game from its full potential. It’s easily accessible to newcomers, despite the weapon triangle’s removal. The game allows players to continue using characters after they lose on the battlefield before starting, often leading to a dull experience in the long run. However, players cannot change the game’s difficulty after starting, making the gameplay experience tough to balance. Luckily, it’s solved and complicated by Three Houses’ replayability through its multiple campaigns.

Three Houses also introduces a calendar system, where players and their classmates study and improve their talents, offering multiple advantages on and off the battlefield. The calendar system compliments the game’s hub world, where players interact with NPCs and complete side quests. It’s also where players build character support levels and collect items and weapons for battles. However, the calendar system, and the hub world, lack substance as the game progresses. It’s one of the only parts of the game that lacks replayability, making subsequent playthroughs more enduring in nature outside of the game's storyline and battles.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses deserves to be a mainstay in the Fire Emblem franchise. It's characters and overarching narrative offer multiple paths and allows new experiences in each playthrough. Each character offers something different from another, both in personality and battle skills. The game may lack innovative battle mechanics and a game-changing calendar system, but what’s there is already bound to impress many incoming players. Three Houses may not be a fantastic game that changes video games forever. However, it welcomes newcomers to a dedicated, long-lasting franchise known for its characters and strategy mechanics."

  ",10,"One of my favourite Fire Emblem games, with great choice of characters for all the three houses and they all have so much depth and personality, you want to know more about every one of them, interact with them as much as possible and possibily find your romance interest. The main story is very engaging and is unique depending on the house you choose to play, so a lot of replayability value. The gameplay and maps are well done. The story takes place in a military school with three different houses, an amazing concept which reminds of Harry Potter. I love how the artwork and the portraits of the characters overall."

  ",9,"The Apex of the tactical role playing strategy genre.
Three Houses was my very first Fire Emblem game, and surprisingly, it's very beginner friendly, the gameplay itself is smooth, simple and straight to the point, and the overall difficulty is quite easy. As for the combat mechanics, they're very well made, everything works as intended, overall it's a blast.

The social simulation aspect is very enjoyable, I really liked exploring the Garreg Mach Monastery, bonding with the characters, doing side activities and interacting with the things around me. It does get slightly repetitive after a while though, because the amount of things you can do are limited, but it never really bothered me.

I also want to point out the fact that the music is great, Japanese Role Playing games usually tend to have an exceptional soundtrack and this game is no different, especially when it comes to the battle themes.

And now, arguably one of the most interesting parts of the game, the story... it's pretty good, but the pacing is questionable, some plot points are solved very quickly, which results in confusion. The lore is intriguing and deep, every House has a different story to tell, you will meet new characters and learn more things about the world.

The characters are cool, every single one of them is likeable and they all have their own little personalities and quirks. You can also recruit some of them in your team, and even change their class to make them play however you please, which I really appreciated.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a fascinating game, it was enjoyable from start to finish even with the pacing issues, and I genuinely had a phenomenal time playing it. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get into the series, even if you've never played a Fire Emblem game before, this is the best place to start, probably the best strategy game I've ever played.

Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10."

Graphics & Sound: Decent looking game and a pleasant soundtrack, though forgettable. I loved how almost every character was voice acted. 3.25/5

Story: I loved the vibe of the game, the story was good enough to keep me engaged from start to finish. While the sim stuff eventually got a bit old, I genuinely loved it at first. It was a nice way to spend time in-between battles. Some memorable moments. 3.5/5

Technicals: No bugs noticed, framerate was a bit rough at times. Didn't hurt my enjoyment, but could have been better. 3.5/5

Gameplay: I loved upgrading the weapons, leveling up the classes, customizing my characters, and the challenge in some fights. The difficulty had some jarring spikes though. Tons of fun, I found myself constantly going, ""One more battle..."" 4/5

Replayability: Multiple routes to go through, but the first-half felt very ""samey"" in my second play-through and I knew how to play a lot better so it made it mindlessly easy. Unfortunately you can not adjust difficulty to be harder. 4/5

Overall: I really loved this game in my first play-through. I have issues with the game, but the sum of everything was greater than everything individually. I whole-heartedly recommend this to new-to-tactics players, it revitalized my love for the genre. 4.25/5"

  ",10,"I played the game in the order of Azure Moon, Verdant Wind, Silver Snow, and Crimson Flower. Although there has been some criticism towards the Crimson Flower story, I found Edelgard to be the best video game character I have ever seen.

Edelgard is a unique character, not a simple villain or hero. Many players overlook the fact that she is also a victim of the feudal system. The tragedy that occurs is a result of the Church's long-term rule and their use of Crests as a system. Although this may have provided surface-level peace in Fodlan, the dark side has never been eliminated. Additionally, there is no indication in the story that the Church made any attempt to eliminate ""those who slither in the dark.""

Edelgard is the one who raises the flag and fights for change. Although some may argue that war brings harm, as a leader, there are some things that cannot wait and must be taken care of immediately. Why ask her to believe that time can bring about the necessary changes? The unknown future may bring about an even worse outcome. Viewing the world from her perspective, Edelgard only aimed to fulfill her noble ideals."

  ",0,"What to say really. As a classic Fire Emblem fan and one who appreciates some of the newer games like awakening this game just isn't fire emblem. I get it's mainstream and in turn was many peoples first ""fire emblem"" game and that's okay if you like it, but this game isn't Fire Emblem it should have been a persona spinoff. If they really wanted to make a persona game they should have asked atlus because atlus does it better. Instead we got a game where boring and mundane social mechanics are integral to the story progression and they removed the weapon triangle something that gives fire emblem it's identity. That would be like removing pokemon types. It removes the identity from the game. As a fire emblem fan I can never recommend this game to another fire emblem fan simply because it spits in the face of what fire emblem is known for and does it's own thing all the while waltzing around with the name ""fire emblem"", but it isn't even fully made by intelligent systems. If you enjoy half baked social mechanics and baby mechanics that make a game way to easy with no challenge then this game might be for you, but if you're a fire emblem fan who appreciates all the good things that the series has done then just stay away from this one because it takes away so much and instead turns this game into a social sim with no real accomplishments in return for them."

  ",8,"It's an improvement over the FE: Fates, tries out some new ideas, but visibly lacks polish. I'd say its better to wait for DLCs and patches to add content before playing it.

+ Some new management/life simulator elements that allow for breaks between the battles.
+ They ""somewhat"" dialed down the waifuism in the games. Sure they still all look like anime, but they mostly look of legal age and you're not related to them.
+Some of the support conversations were actually fun to read and also explained some of the lore of the universe.
+/-The story lets you believe they actually hired writers this time, although they struggle with keeping up a good suspense. Every time the secrets of the protagonists are on the verge of being revealed, the game has to force in some disturbance so the story can keep going on.

- The graphics... just look ugly. The character models have strange outlines and the lighting makes a lot of environments look very plain. The game also seems to drain more power than the Switch can charge which can lead to resolution bugs at 1% battery.
- The game is too repetitive. To fully explore all paths you'd need to play it 3 times, but really only the 2nd half changes per playthrough. A lot of battle maps are recycled which also doesn't keep combat fresh either. The life simulator minigames can also turn into a real grind. Especially that fishing game. Why oh why did they include that?
- The game hasn't really been balanced/tested too well. Some classes are significantly superior to others and mount penalties are meaningless. There is also no weapon triangle, so there's no incentive to master more than 1 weapon category."

Si bien tiene demasiados aciertos, la verdad es que los fallos que tiene aunque no opaquen a sus buenos aciertos, estos errores son los suficientemente graves para no convertirlo en el Fire Emblem definitivo desde mi punto de vista, primeramente es que el juego puede llegarse a tornar muy monótono y repetitivo con el sistema del hub world y repetir eso durante 22 capítulos haciendo casi lo mismo no hace mucha gracia y puede que lo llegues a dejar, el juego aun si lo tienes en dificultad extrema parece que no pasa de dificultad media y la inteligencia artificial es demasiado absurda y te dejan casi todo en bandeja de plata, el juego es demasiado fácil y este punto es peor aun por culpa del pulso divino, en el apartado técnico he experimentado framerates muy frecuentes por el hub world y un popping ridículo y los gráficos y texturas de mala calidad parecen dignos y podrían quedar perfectamente en una PlayStation 2.
A pesar de todo Three Houses es un juego recomendable seas veterano en esto de los juegos tácticos por turnos o seas alguien nuevo que quiere introducirse en este genero de juegos, con una trama y gameplay espectacular, espero que su sucesor Fire Emblem Engage pueda limpiar todos los errores de 3H y mejorar pulir aun mas los mejores aspectos de este hasta dejar la vara alta.

The story was also surprisingly decent, and the choice of which group you align with gives you 3 very different endings.

Smash bros really is an amazing business move as an advertiser for different games. I became interested in the Fire Emblem series when playing Smash bros, as Robin and Chrom in particular became 2 of my favorite characters in the game. I wanted to play the game that they were featured in, but found that the installment (Awakening) only is available on the 3Ds and I didn't have access to that, but I did obviously own the Nintendo Switch, so instead of pursuing Awakening, I had no choice but to get Three Houses instead. One of the best decisions in my entire life. I watched the gameplay and it peaked my interest. Then I watched streams and read reviews that all were in favor of the game. I already had high expectations for the game and even felt a bit hyped upon getting it. However... I didn't expect something like this.

I just **** love it. The game is pretty anime-like and the story is legendary. I won't go into why I feel like this about the story, as it would turn this already long review into a university M.D essay. The music and battle music in particular is amazing and epic. The gameplay and especially combat system is amazing. It's like chess, but way more complex. So many factors that plays into it, some examples being different abilities, crests, weapon effectiveness, stat modifiers from gambits and items, linked attacks and so much more.
The cast individually are impressively written and complex individuals, most with backstories that fits and makes sense of their personalities and the main characters' motives. It makes them feel like alive, real world humans, hence is a big part of why you feel like a real professor with real adorable students when playing.
The voice acting also is top-notch. I could go on and on with the positives of this game, but I actually have 1 complaint about this masterpiece.
That being the graphics. In all honesty, the graphics and animation is terrible with today's standard. It almost looks like the game belongs to the N64.

That being said, I have recently deep inside of me come to accept a harsh reality. The Zelda games is by far my favorite gaming franchise. It's not even close. Thus, I will always have a huge bias towards the Zelda games. Before getting this game, I thought that Breath of the Wild was the best game on the Nintendo Switch and I initially still thought so even after getting Three Houses. However, as the game slowly, but surely progressed in greatness, I started to doubt it. It was a harsh battle between the games. I would either say that they're equally good or that Breath of the Wild is slightly better. I always favored Zelda, because of what I expressed earlier, but as time went on I knew that it wasn't the case. I kept lying to myself until I couldn't take it anymore.
Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the best game on the Nintendo Switch.

I finally completed all of the routes recently and with 375+ hours in the bag, I figured that I was done and that I would buy the DLC later on and replay it. Nope. After a week I went ahead and started yet another playthrough. I still haven't even bought the DLC. I couldn't resist it. It's like trying to resist an extremely attractive, erection inducing woman who eventually drags you in.

  ",3,"Fire Emblem Three Houses is an extremely lacking game that utilizes political ideologies as an aesthetic to cover up it's directionless story. The story is superficial, character interactions feel incredibly forced and unnatural, and it's artificially bloated with fetch quests. Snappy pacing which was once a highlight of the series is now gone. And there are no rewards for sitting through an entire in game month to reach the gameplay because the majority of maps are dull.

After the initial wow factor of the game being customizable, I found myself wishing I was playing Tellius again. The game advertises itself to have multiple routes, but in reality it's approximately two routes. And the best map design is seen in the route they spent the least amount of time on.

The social simulation aspect was not fun for me. Being a teacher who dates their former students is so weird. Not to mention all the people who justify it by saying Byleth (who's over 20 at the start) is close in age to these characters (the youngest being 14/15) so it's okay somehow. As if that's not the textbook definition of grooming?

Byleth as a character is the worst main character in Fire Emblem history. Worse than Corrin because at least Corrin was born with half a personality. They're a blank slate made for the character to project into. The game tries to get you to believe that this bland empty husk has somehow changed lives and is fit to assist politics. Blue Lions route being one of the worst offenders for me because every dialogue ""choice"" is there to comfort characters I would rather not. If we could play as the lords instead of them with more concrete writing, the character interactions would have been salvageable.

There was nothing I enjoyed in this game except for a handful of characters with wasted potential. If you think the writing in this game is good in any capacity please play Tactics Ogre."

If you are a fire emblem fan like me, you'll enjoy what's on offer here and know what you're getting.
Roughly speaking, you won't be surprised by anything besides the shameful technical performance.
Plenty of replay value.

THE BAD
Waifu/relationship related rubbish is still present, and while it does affect gameplay in a positive and meaningful way, it doesn't belong in  a fire emblem game.
At least, not amped up to this level, in any case.

I love JRPG so much where Switch is like a home for the genre and holly molly, this game is insanely that good.

It's tactical, turn based RPG so it's obviously not for everyone but for JRPG fan, I believe you already bought this game.

Story, characters and how you improve as a professor is just an amazing experience besides tons of feature and activity you can do in the game.

Completely cannot fully described how good this game is as there are a lot to talk about, you can do lot of things besides combat in this game which is the charm of this game.

If you just a casual gamer, you can give this game a try. If you are a hack & slash, action or adventure gamer, I don't think you'll enjoy this game. If you are into narrative or story-driven game, this game has a very engaging story lot of characters that you can nurture your relationship with.

  ",8,"One of the best games on the Switch! I personally believe that this game is a must have for anyone who owns a switch or is interested in tactical RPGs or RTSs. Fire Emblem: Three Houses offers a surprisingly deep story and lore supported by some of the best written characters in any RPG I've played. The game features engaging yet challenging combat alongside one of the best soundtracks on the switch accompanied by stellar voice acting. Although I consider this FE's magnum opus, it isn't without it's flaws. My biggest gripe with this game is the class mastery system which I find way too grindy, I finished Azure Moon with 999 battles on Gilbert and Hilda and around 660 on Dedue and Alois just because of all the times I threw them in a thicket with a broken lance as a fortress knight just so I could master the abilities I wanted on my main cast, it's too long and grindy and it just feels cheap. Another fairly major problem this game has is that the monastery (especially at A+ professor rank) is pretty boring, I found myself in all playthroughs at part 2 just falling in the same free time loop, share a meal with my main cast, enter the sauna with my main cast, instruct, do choir or cooking sometimes, repeat. I know this game was on a pretty tight development cycle but I still wish exploring was almost as deep as Persona 5's exploring with more to do and less restrictions. My remaining issues are pretty small but they do add up to a non-insignificant amount annoyance. FPS issues, Beginning of the game restrictions in NG+ (disabled fast travel and inaccessible facilities), minor plot holes (Blood of the Eagle and Lion), Crimson Flower being unfinished, and some side characters being fairly two dimensional (Ignatz, Lorenz, Catherine, Cyril, Raphael, etc.). Even though I just spent half the paragraph talking about the flaws of this game, but I believe this is still one of the best switch games and is a shed of light in the toxic and over monetized current games industry.

TLDR: Brilliant but flawed. PLAY THE GAME!!!!"

  ",10,"This is going to be a personal-opinion review where I will not try too hard to be objective.

Fire Emblem Three Houses is pretty close to being the best game of all time, only rivaled by The Witcher 3 and Elden Ring

Let's start with the negative stuff. What I disliked:
* Locked on Nintendo Switch and not (easily) available on PC
* Lackluster graphics; this is directly connected to the first point... The graphics could be better on platforms that are not as technically-challenged as Nintendo Switch
* Paid DLCs

Now here are the things that I liked:
* A perfect length of 40 hours - not long enough to get bored
* Tactical battles with many unique situations and challenges
* No endless RPG grind, no RPG level-up BS: on normal difficulty, the number of battles you can fight is strictly limited, so the player starts each story-mission with what they've got and you cannot go back into an ""open world"" to level up a few more times. This is great for game balance; you will rarely feel overpowered
* Awesome voiced dialogues that are neither too short nor too long. It is up to you whether you want to say something that people want to hear in response, or just have fun
* The voice lines in combat are great too: attack, defense, concern, cheer up - they're all nicely done, and without those voice lines, the battles would not feel as immersive
* Decent lore and story, which is way more than most games released since 2017 can offer
* You can play favorites with the students. Of course, you will help everyone in the end, because the success of the mission depends on each one's ability, but you will just put that extra bit of care into teaching and equipping the few select students that you like the most. And before you judge me, remember that this is just human nature, and it always happens in real life whether we want it or not. We can completely eliminate favoritism only when we remove human supervisors from the equation entirely.
* Flashy combat animations, detailed equipment and armors. Almost each piece of equipment has its own unique model
* A cool protagonist. I usually pick female player character when I play games, but for my Fire Emblem 3-Houses walkthrough I picked a dude; and, surprisingly, I did not regret it! The dude is the very definition of ""cool"". This is again a stark contrast with the majority of modern games... Although the player character is silent and makes only few decisions that influence the story, it did not stop me from feeling impressed. The game makes you feel that you are the person who can get everyone alive through every battle, no matter the circumstances
* The combat moves of the protagonist are satisfying to watch every single time, and protag's clothes & armors are nicely designed; this is equally true for both male and female versions.
* A great selection of wives. In this regard, Fire Emblem 3 Houses is better than most ""erotic"" games could ever hope to be; because Fire Emblem presents you people with actual stories, personalities; it gives you the sense of bonding with someone who have been through a lot with you. You can go into battle with your ""loved one"" and observe the real consequences of your care: oh, you forgot to pack a healing potion for your wife? Well, tough luck! Now she's surrounded by bandits with no hope of escaping. Same goes for shields, swords and stuff. You better not misjudge what sort of weapon will be adequate for the next mission. The danger of failure makes you worried; however, seeing your ""loved one"" do well fills you with joy. When you see your wife dispatch bandits and crazed wolves with ease, or maybe save some of your students from an otherwise-hopeless situation, it is a very special feeling
* A satisfying ending that does not feel rushed; which is something that many story-driven games struggle get right

Overall a great game that prolly deserves it's score of 8.8 on MetaCritic at the time when I wrote this review; I hope that Nintendo will cOnSiDeR creating a new Fire Emblem game after they release the upcoming Xenoblade 3."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses es un RPG táctico muy profundo e interesante, con partes de gestión y socialización para profundizar en los personajes. La historia es interesante, y muy rejugable, ya que tiene 4 rutas diferentes, donde cambian los finales y los personajes, según la clase que hayas elegido. Hay muchísimos personajes, y tendrán más o menos relevancia según la historia que elijas, siendo muchos de ellos muy memorables. El combate está muy bien desarrollado, siendo muy gratificante de jugar en dificil, y dando la posibilidad de activar la opción clásica de la saga de muerte permanente, que añade un punto de dificultad muy disfrutable. La parte de gestión del monasterio, si quieres profundizar en la historia de los personajes, es muy entretenida. En caso de que no te interese, puede omitirse. A nivel visual y sonoro es muy bonito, y perfectamente optimizado. Lo mejor es el equilibrio que tiene el juego, así como sus numerosos contenidos y alta rejugabilidad.

It didn't feel like the (by many) so called ""dating sim mechanics"" were dating sim mechanics, but more like bonding mechanics. Making the losses on the battlefield even more tragic. So i recommend playing on classic normal or classic hard. This really makes the game better and more enjoyable. The story is also very good. With a lot of choices that actually have a LOT of impact on the story.
I never get how people give games a zero. This game is by NO means worth a zero. The only thing this game has against himself are the graphics. While the graphics in battle are fine, in cutscenes and conversation they are not on par with any other AAA game on the switch.

  ",6,"I really do not understand the praise this game gets. This game is really tedious and such a time sink of meaningless stuff to do.

I really liked some of the story telling aspects but it takes absolutely forever for the story to get anywhere. I think like 35 hours in and was thinking to myself 'wow, absolutely nothing is going on'.

I understand build up but the pacing was just awful. This really needed to start earlier in the time line then it did. Overall you're dealing with a lot of 'day in the life' type story telling. You're essentially learning characters and their past to get more attached to them. I liked it at first. Then it just sorta only delivers that such a significant chunk of this game. It stops being interesting and feels more like a necessary time sink to level of friendships or characters.

Some of the characters back stories I felt were completly necessary like for the main leaders. But all these side characters could have been summarized a lot better or just had a lot of useless fat cut. You often get the same character with the same story beats over and over again. Bernadetta for example, how many ways can they show her being an anxious mess? After like the 30th time without really much expansion into her, it gets tired. Only a handful of these plot lines with side characters feel like it matters or you actually learn something.

The fetch quest situation in the monastery also was incredibly taxing. You have gift giving, lost items and just generic quests where you go talk 'fetch' to a NPC or go to a designated area to find something. All this feels forced and necessary to get the most out of the game too. You can spend hours each in game month just doing fetch quests to increase relationship stats, get much needed items or increase motivation. None of it is interesting and feels disrespectful of my time. None of this added to the story as you always get this generic 'oh i cant believe you found that' response too, so it doesn't feel rewarding story wise either.

The only saving grace is the combat, it's amazing. I feel smart and love puzzling through them. The rpg mechanics for it are great too. I love seeing a character upgrade and get stronger.

Unfortunately there is so much monastery junk and not so interesting story beats in between each combat session. You could spend hours with all this monastery stuff, just to get to and finish a 30 minute event to do combat in and then onto more tedious monastery stuff.

This game exhausted me more then charmed me. In fact, I think I hate it for disrespecting my time. I can't imagine playing through these scenerios the required 4 times to see everything. Once was enough to understand that it's wasting your time."

  ",10,"Few video games can so deftly weave together a compelling story with challenging and interesting gameplay while still maintaining some level of mass appeal. But Fire Emblem: Three Houses absolutely knocks it out of the park - perhaps even more than any of its predecessors.

Three Houses made it next to impossible for me to return to any of the previous Fire Emblem games. Its characters are extremely compelling, due to a combination of stellar voice work from a passionate cast, along with solid writing (in terms of both the characters and the story they all play a part in). Almost no (main) character in this game is relegated to being forgettable. Some will annoy you; others will absolutely steal your heart; all of the students of the eponymous three houses will prove to be at least somewhat interesting. The story, too, is so much more nuanced and compelling than its predecessors - while some paths you can take in the game offer more complexity and character development, the overarching narrative is one that you will almost certainly be completely swept up in,

While the gameplay has all the hallmarks of a Fire Emblem game, Three Houses has refined the strategy role-playing mechanics of prior games, while also doing away with some of the tropes developed in Awakening that seemed shoehorned into Fates. It can also potentially offer even more depth and variety than its predecessors in terms of how you wish to develop its characters. To put it simply, nearly every single student is a blank canvas, and they can become whatever you wish them to be - as such, this is easily the most customizable Fire Emblem game yet.

Three Houses is accessible, compelling, and provided me with an absolutely unforgettable gaming experience. If you have any desire to play this wonderful game, please do yourself a favour and act on it."

  ",9,"Intro:
* This is a no-spoiler review. It will only go as deep as strictly needed. Everything more will be properly marked as spoiler.
* I played the game without ever using the online functions, thus they will not be discussed
* This review takes into consideration only the game itself, without any type of comparison with previous games of the series.
* The game features four different routes. Three of them are chosen at the beginning of the game, while the fourth one (called “Crimson Flower”) can only be unlocked midgame during a specific other route. For this reason, throughout this review I will refer to it as the “Secret Route”.

Pro:
+ Selectable difficulty from Normal to Maddening
+ Selectable mode (Casual and Classic), which makes you decide whether you want the perma-death of your units or not
+ Mechanic to “turn back time” during the combat (only for a limited number of time per stage) in order to modify previous wrong actions
+ Even though there is half game of “common route”, it has different insights of the story in each different route, thus not making it boring to replay
+ Many different things to do in the game (support conversations, minigames, chatting with characters, build them with an RPG system and turn-based grid battles)
+ More than 30 different playable characters
+ Most of the characters are interesting and well written, and different from each other
+ Really good variety of support conversations between paris of characters
+ Really good soundtrack
+ Many build possibilities for the characters
+ The DLC adds an interesting side-story, four new classes and characters and many features for improving replayability
+ Many (and good) characters’ endings
+ Good gameplay variety
+ Huge amount of content (each of the four routes is roughly ~40 hours)
+ To “fully” cover the main story, two routes are enough if chosen correctly
+ Possibility to romance characters with the protagonist and to create romances between pairs of characters
+ Many optional side quests, and most of the ones with important rewards have a way of getting the reward later if previously missed
+ Many possible strategies and builds at low Difficulties
+ Really good voice acting both in japanese and in english, except for a few exceptions
+ [Minor Spoiler] Good differences in characters (also visually) pre and post timeskip

Cons:
- Some of the (many) tutorials are not really clear
- Since you can only do a certain amount of “actions” before being forced to do the following main story battle, it is possible to be hard-locked (even more if playing with perma-death mode)
- Characters have only two fixed body-type for classes, so a slim mage will visually have a muscular body if reclassed to a brawler class
- With perma-death, if a character dies, there will be not a single line about that from the other characters; the only difference will be that there will be missing dialogue from that character in the cutscenes
- The classes’ requirements should be better displayed in all the menus in which they could be useful
- Some classes are genderlock with absolutely no good reason
- The DLC’s english translations are really bad
- The Secret Route is incomplete, with also missing cutscenes
- Many side activities become extremely boring to do when replaying the game for the different routes
- Bad division between main story, support conversations and documents (like important information for the main story are in some optional support conversations and vice-versa)
- Items’ menus ****
- There are few same-sex marriage endings (unless the protagoinist is involved) and some have no reasons not to be avilable
- Really slow loadings
- Some mechanics (like gardening) have a random seed that makes them incomprehensible
- A few characters have no character development
- Background elements are really low-res
- A very powerful and useful class is DLC-only
- Routes are made artificially different in some points even though it doesn’t make much sense just to keep them all unique
- [Minor Spoiler] Some Support discussion are locked after the timeskip if not done before it, even though they could have used something like flashbacks

Miscellanous:
* Routes are not meant to be a “what if”, but they are actually different stories. For example, if in a Route a character was doing something in the shadows, it might not be doing it in another Route even though nothing related to that character has changed in the story
* Characters’ weapons have durability, but it is well balanced
* As mentioned before, each route takes around 40 hours to complete, for a total of ~160 hours to play them all. The DLC side story is long ~8 hours"

Pros
The characters
The strategy
The theme
Cons
The story is just okay
DLC was somewhat disappointing
Game art
This game plays like a soap opera. Each character has their own arc that reacts to the story of the game. FETH won an award for the voice acting in it, which means that however corny the game might get, at least it rocks its corniness. This game became a target for memes because that’s what it aims to do. You’re supposed to interact with each character and feel a certain reaction to them. Over time, you get to know their likes and dislikes and that changes your opinion about them. Some characters are more two dimensional than others, but there are characters worth getting to know in every house. I look at some and think, “You pansy…” some I relate to or think of my own friends, and others I find myself rooting for.
The strategy is satisfying, and there’s a wide range of difficulty settings to work with. You can choose to remove permadeath, and I’m sure you could choose to not use the option to go back in time to fix mistakes if you set yourself to that standard.
Fire Emblem is a tactical strategy game about war. But what it does with its characters is explore different reactions to conflict and how loyalties get mixed in. Three houses tells the perspective of the main story from—surprise—each house. Problem is that each game will usually run about 70 hours. That’s both good and bad depending on your opinion. The nice thing? This game plays EXACTLY as marketed, so you can look at reviews from big names like IGN or GameSpot etc and decide if the game looks fun to you before buying it. I picked this game up on a whim because I liked how the strategy of strengthening each character looked and it delivered what it promised. In the hours you play, you will do a fair amount of grinding, but there are “bonding” moments between characters that shake things up. Don’t like the grind? You can simulate through a lot of that and focus on the main story…but what has fans happy with the game is how good it feels to feel like you’re a part of the monastery.
I was fine with the DLC. It added four new characters, new features, and new classes. I wasn’t wowed by it, but I also wouldn’t want to be without it since I love the game so much (yes I have played through each ending). If graphics matter to you, you’ll also probably want to play the game docked since there is a glaring difference in graphics between docked and undocked. I thoroughly enjoyed the game in every way, and hope you check it out!"

Your characters can be molded pretty much into whatever roll you want them to. Each character still keeps its own identity and feel with natural preferences for certain skills/weapons, but there is so much freedom in this game. The story is definitely one of the better ones for the Fire Emblem series. You'll find yourself very invested in your house. Although the game does seem like it expects you to play through each house, because if you don't you'll miss key details in the overall story. So be prepared to spend A LOT of time playing if you want the full experience. The game definitely provides plenty of content."

  ",10,"Edit: A note about the 0/10 scores on here. People are allowed an opinion. Giving a zero doesn't mean they are counterbalancing 10/10's they don't agree with.  For starters if you don't like playing with subtitles, then this is an instant 0/10. The voice acting is shockingly bad. The dialogue is just as bad with heirs to the throne all using the slang of a 10 year old and it just sounds stupid. Lorenz, Bernadette, Marrianne, (I could list more) are just total **** heads to put in a game. Claude isn't far behind them. Some people just outright don't like the anime art style, I prefer that style but not everyone does. There is dating, yes in game dating. It is **** stupid. It would be much better to give a prompt saying would you like to stare at Manuela's **** for 30 seconds and yes/no options. It is now possibly my favourite game ever and I am surprised still at how high it scores. It has some big gaping holes in its production.

Anyone saying this voice acting is good, is either very young, or very deaf, or just accept crap acting.

Permadeath is also optional, some reviews made out like you can't play with permadeath. You can.

So after getting that out of the way, here is my review.

I usually can't stand AAA games 'cos they are usually over hyped rubbish. At first I thought the same when I started playing this too. I expected a chess style game like the amazing FE Radiant Dawn on Wii but then started playing and thought what is this God awful walking sim.  As I was ready to trade it/sling it across the room, something just clicked and I loved it.

Now this has elements that I normally can't stand like levelling up, fetch quests, terrible voice acting, walking sim, I could go on forever but suddenly after a few hours, I enjoyed it. For some reason I got dragged in to the world of crappy dialogue, crappy VA (even the **** VA sounds OTT and cheesy) and running around the base/monastry with pointless missions and thoroughly enjoyed it. Was it the music? Possibly, as I could sit and listen to the music and the game just be a bonus.

I have seen people slating the graphics on this, I loved it. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to work in context and with the other game elements, which it does extremely well. It looked like a nice anime style to me.

Sound - the music is amazing, the voice acting the same as every other game - totally annoying rubbish. Audio wise, this is at a level where I youtube the songs, or leave the game running even when I've finished play to carry on listening.

Gameplay, I enjoy the strategy chess bits and I enjoy the in between sim bits a hell of a lot.

For me this is a AAA deserving the price tag. Quickly becoming a favourite ever game of mine. The negatives with this don't warrant point deduction because my enjoyment, fun and value of this are all 10. I couldn't put it down, now on 2nd run and clocked 100 hours and bought DLC and still can't put it down.

I've come back to this review, just to add that after A Link to the Past this is the only game that has left a void in my gaming life, when I finished it. Everything else just feels lame now.

It is absolutely offensive that this beast **** is only scored .3 higher than Persona 5.  PUT is a boring boring game compared to this.  FE3H has polish and flare.  PUT feels childish.

It is very hard to get a good grasp **** these days from reviews.  People will rate any old junk 10/10.  This though, absolutely deserves it."

The story was amazing from start to finish and beautiful animated cutscenes and battles. The 4 endings, fully voice story, massive cast of characters with unique personality, amazing battles, the supports were well done and of course the iceing on the cake is the music. The music is amazing from slow track to the battle tracks that pomp you up and to more emotional moment in the game to fit the mood. This game is a must and so is the DLC as well, the games price is well suited for how much content is in the game at about over 250 hours or maybe even more it depends.

Very long too, all 4 routes will easily set you back 200 hours give or take. Excellent game are arguably the best fire emblem, though it is very untraditional for the series taking many cues form Gaiden, the black sheep of the franchise. I would prefer is the next original fire emblem game was more focused with a single route with branching paths leading to the same result instead of 4 completely different routes with multiple choices that change the story greatly and more traditional gameplay like a more limited class system and tighter map design like the Arcanea games and Thracia. Though I do like divine pulse and magic being tied to character rather than specific weapons. Keep those please."

Verdant Moon Story: That guy just randomly massacred people for fun but that's totally okay since he's traumatized! We'll help him since we are his friends! And he is totally redeemable!

Crimson Flower Story: That gal just randomly committed genocide against religion and committed human experiments and attacked a neutral alliance but that's okay since she is traumatized and thinks she is the justice! She has no idea how she'll build her next government (yeah like she literally starts to figure that out in the support dialogues. Which means that she had no plans about what her ideal government structure should be when she started attacking the church) but decides to overthrow the current government that has been doing decent for the past thousands of years! But that's okay since she hates them and ""thinks"" they are the bad ones! (Slither whatever guys were the actual bad ones but she never figures it out since she's just dumb) She'll selectively choose who can be killed and who doesn't have to be depending on her mood but that's 100% okay since she's forging her own path!

Oh Jesus... I hate how this game constantly tries to justify the genocides of civilians. The story tries to tell me that it's all for the good cause, but no. All the stories and war crimes the characters are committing are wrapped with pretty words and packed with great character design. The game was fun enough. I was infuriated when I played it at launch (2019), and I still rant about how bad the story is even to this day (2021). I hated both Dimitri and Edelgard due to how poorly written their stories were.

On top of that, I hate how the game portrays visual/racial minorities. I'm really uncomfortable with Petra and Dedue's characters. Residential schools and missionizations of first native people is a real thing, and the Devs don't even bother to portray that properly. I'm an immigrant myself and I well know that kids start to forget their mother tongue only after an year or so. The game tries to wrap itself so that it seems like the story is criticizing imperialism and racism, but in truth it's not. It's only embracing those false ideals. How they talk about the issues is overly shallow and insensitive.

Must admit, I loved the game play, but this is the most disgusting story I've seen in a video game. I still can't sleep at night when start thinking about it. I thought FE Fates had a pretty bad story, but that was just a bad story and nothing else. FE3H's story is not only bad but also very immoral. I hate it to death."

If you're new to FE, deciding where you should start, and don't want to start with Awakening(because maybe you feel it's dated) then I highly recommend this game. Some of the old school players don't like the improvements made to the games over the years but I quite enjoy it. It's like the development took notes from Persona and found ways to implement them in the game. It's kinda cool to have a self insert protagonist(but they really need to stray them away from using swords). They keep trying to make the games have an open world/sandboxy mechanic. Also, as someone who enjoys persona it was refreshing that they added a new experience to a beloved franchise.
Lastly, the in game CG for cutscenes has improved from their previous ports, the music is timeless, and the character design are great(Marianne is my favorite)."

And it is far too easy to level up your players and end up with a team that is near invincible, at which point you can spam auto-battle on each turn and just roll over your opponent. It’s such a pity because there is so much great customisation and thought that has been poured into the skill and character class creation.

  ",10,"Let me preface by saying I have never played a Fire Emblem game, and I am not a big tactics style game fan, but I don't hate them, I just tend to find them lacking story and the gameplay isn't engaging enough, however Fire Emblem Three Houses perhaps may be the best game in the genre.

The story is quite honestly, perhaps the best story on a nintendo console in years. The game is not surprisingly dark, and the game takes risks in that regard, but it pays off. I would not label it edgy, but I'm more than willing to say its darker than expected. I know nothing of the fire emblem universe, its tropes or practices and knew very little about the game other than you picked a house out of three and played as them. I was wholly unaware that the game took place in a religious setting, however the game's religious themes often can take a backseat, and it's usually for the better. The story is not supremely complex, but it is very rich and there's a whole universe after this game I would've loved to explore.
There is much I could put here about various plot elements, and more that I could express my love for but that would likely spoil or set expectations for those and I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, it should be experienced naturally.

The characters are phenomenal in this game. Every single one with a developed back story that you can unearth by growing closer with them. Many are nobles, sent to learn by their parents to defend their families land, conversely there are nobles who are almost resentful at their nobility. The commoners are not neglected, they're looked down upon by some characters and respected by others. Some of the most interesting characters are poor and their families worked incredibly hard to send everything they could to get their kids through this school. Each one has flaws, hobbies, unique abilities and they can all fit into classes of your choice. Most are obviously geared towards a specific class or style due to their abilities, but that's not bad.

Classes and class diversity is not something I really struggled with. I found quickly though that the game really likes to lean heavily onto mounted units with almost every single ""master"" class being mounted on a flying creature or a horse. This kind of disappointed me and annoyed me as I never saw some of my characters like that, however I found that the leap between master and the tier before it is not required to beat the game or even all that necessary. It's very doable without it, in fact at one point i got one of my characters into a master class, found i didn't like it and just swapped them down one tier with no issues, no expenses, nothing. The ability to adjust your units before a battle to suit what you'd be undertaking is great. Late game classes are generally hybrids so do not think you can get away just dumping all your points into one stat and not struggle to get a master class, but as I said, it's not really required if you aren't fond of that.

In gameplay, it's deceptively simple. On a surface level, the game looks like chess and you trade units until you complete the objective but there is so much nuance that can be learned by playing. Every unit gets a gambit ability which is effectively their special move and can be used very limitedly in a single battle. On top of that, weapons all have durability, and combat arts are special moves that give increased or decreased effectiveness in certain areas but they drain your durability more. The shops are easily accessible though, before and after a fight, so repair, replacement, and forging into a better weapon is always a menu away. You do have a limited inventory, so between trinkets or accessories, weapons, healing items and tools such as keys, you might have to store things on your character, who when stood next to by any other unit can access your armies gear.

I have only completed the game once, however, there are at least three other main story lines to complete. This game is more of an RPG than I ever expected it to be. One thing I would've preferred is more character customization, from what i gather there is a bit if you own DLC but it's just preset outfits. Your characters face, hair, height, weight and more are all the same no matter what. Still an excellent RPG regardless with its branching stories, character relations and stat based gameplay.

Now, in regards to other complaints. It is rather difficult to explain these without going into spoilers but not impossible so I will do it regardless.

I wrote much more other minor complaints but I hit the character limit, however these complaints are minute compared to how fantastic this game is. It is a must have, full price isn't too steep if you plan on multiple play throughs, however on sale it's a steal. Cannot recommend it enough. I rarely give 10s, but this is by far one of the best games in its genre."

  ",10,"The story is engaging, and the strategy gameplay is phenomenal. On maddening difficulty, this game will push your strategy skills to their limits and is incredibly fun! But what sets Three Houses apart from other games in the series is that it retains the traditional tactics-based combat while adding completely new elements of world interaction along with refined character development and relationship building. The lighthearted exploration activities make a nice break from repeated combat.

One potential downside is that the exploration and ""support"" building can take a long time and is no longer fresh on subsequent playthroughs, at which point it can feel rather grindy. To help prevent that, I would encourage NOT maximizing every relationship on the first playthrough. Try to prioritize a few characters and learn their stories, assuming you are interested in the story. On the next playthrough, pick some new characters. There are a few characters that are so good you will want them every time (particularly on maddening), but the game is flexible enough that you can pretty much play and succeed with whichever characters you want.

Bottom line: the story is engaging and the combat delightfully challenging. This game is so good that I created a metacritic account just so I could leave this review. But don't take my word for it; give it a shot if you like strategy games, and see for yourself why it is one of the most highly rated Switch titles on this website."

You really come to care for the characters throughout the campaign, which is a testament to the great writing of this game. If you don't care for all of the ""relationship"" elements of the game, you don't have to listen to the extra conversations in the game, but they do provide a lot of insight into the backgrounds of the characters. The battle system is still super fun, and the story itself is an epic adventure that you won't want to end! It's great how players are given a lot of freedom in this entry, being able to choose between battling, exploring the monastery, or training units, so anyone can play the game the way they'd prefer. This game also has massive replayability, with 4 major story paths to take on (the 3 main ones, and 1 one that branches off from one of those 3, but I can't explain without spoiling). Playing through each path still feels like a pretty fresh experience thanks to the varied casts of characters.

The personality-brimming characters really help pull you into the story and the fact that EVERYTHING is fully-voiced helps spare you from the usual monotonous mountain of dialogue that you’d be met with in other RPGs.

I love it when Sims are interwoven into the game instead of straight up one or the other and Three Houses definitely delivered on that front. If you enjoyed games like Ni No Kuni 2, any persona game or any trails game then you’ll really enjoy this game. It feels like playing a Harry Potter game mixed with game of thrones. Different people come from different places and they have different cultures. The story is amazing regardless of which House you pick and they’re all unique. You could play differently with one house three times over, easily.

  ",8,"WIP REVIEW!

As a PC and PS4 gamer it was interesting trying out the switch and play Fire Emblem.
I loved FE on the GameCube so I looked forward to the ""different"" FE game on Switch.

First ""playthrough"" landed on about 10 hours but I decided to restart because I choose Normal+Classic.
If you like Strategy games normal is way too easy, I would always suggest classic because (trying not to spoil) there is two ways to undo someone's death in the game.

Hard+Classic at a glance changes base stats like hit chances, now I cannot overreach with characters and I have to think hard about which weapon to use based of the hit stat. Something I barely needed to pay attention to on Normal.

Graphics:
Nintendos decision to make a portable console reflects on the graphics. Much like PS2 era games, the 2d art is gorgeous but the 3d animations are stiff like much of the textures.
Prepare for that if you're coming of PC games or even PS4 games.

Monastery:
You'll spend quite some time outside of combat, here you will do quests, converse with characters and more!
While I had my doubts in the beginning the game does an excellent job of slowly giving you the tools and understanding of how it all works.
One amazing thing is that they give you the option to fast travel very early, so running around the monastery doesn't take too long.

The only thing I really found lacking was explanation of the classes. If you look online there is obvious better choices for some characters then others, and the game does a terrible job to relay this to the player.

I feel like the characters should more clearly tell me what they want to become so I can guide them towards that goal. Needing to rely on other people and the online community is not optimal.

Then it just devolved into an extremely simplistic mindless plot for the most part. It has a couple of interesting ideas but squander them completely. The combat is solid, albeit repetitive. I found the main loop for me being levelling up characters to fit certain classes. It is enjoyable but not as fleshed out as something like divinity 2. Then there's side stuff. Being a professor is kind of fun but the monastery freeroam is appalling. The amount of stuff to do is vast but they're is the equivelant of going through spam emails to get rid of the unread icon. The quests are the bare minimum to define something as a quest. They're so bad they let you fast travel through fetch quests. The characters save the show but they're far from great. The professor the self has the personality of a potato. The graphics are something between the ps2 and Ps3. All in all I enjoyed it but I'd never touch this game if it wasn't portable."

  ",8,"Three Houses is certainly a step up in the series in terms of storytelling and gameplay accessibility.  I found the 3DS titles to be slightly too difficult on the causal setting, but Three Houses has dialed back the difficulty substantially, which I, and many other novice strategists I'm sure, greatly appreciate.  Three Houses also fully realizes the central hub concept which was explored in Fates, and expands upon it majorly.  Walking around the monastery is a nice change of pace from the battle sections, though completing the various tasks did become a bit tedious in the latter half of the game.  The story is generally more engaging than ever before, the central characters have a bit more depth to them than in the series past.  There's also a fair bit of intrigue, many characters have fairly detailed backstories that are gradually unfurled as you go along.  That being said, the way they delivered some of these vital pieces of information was a bit lacking, leading to a few instances of anticlimax.  Speaking of anticlimax, one of the biggest issues I have with this title is the sheer amount of content, though I do recognize that for many this will be the game's greatest asset.  I found myself a bit bored with the gameplay loop by the last few hours of the game, and the final months of my Blue Lions playthrough did test my patience.  This is unfortunate, because having completed one of several different routes through the game, which took about 50 hours, I discovered that several key story details are contained within other routes, leading to a bit of disappointment.  The ending itself was fairly satisfying, but I just really dislike the feeling that I'm missing out on vital story details.   I simply don't have the stamina to play through another whole campaign with this same gameplay loop right now, and because of that several plot points either have no resolution, or ones which aren't particularly satisfying.  I think that it is a bit unreasonable to ask players to complete a 50 hour story mode several times to get the full picture of the events which take place, even if there are many enthusiasts who will take it upon themselves to play every route.  I will say, however, that at least Three Houses includes all necessary routes on the cartridge, which was not the case in Fates.  Three Houses is still in most respects a great game, but I do hope that Intelligent Systems returns to one central storyline someday, as the multiple route method just doesn't really mesh with how I play these games."

Combat can get very interesting at ""Hard"" mode with classic setup (permadeath), as long as you are not overleveled. Keep in mind that the graphics of the surroundings are just not good, but characters etc. are well designed for Switch standards. It's like a medieval Persona 5 that is a bit more serious and with a combat system that is more like chess than like Pokemon (in comparison to Persona)."

  ",9,"Three Houses explore mainly three diverged “What if?” scenarios and gives you the illusion that you battle your dear friends to death.

Its gameplay maintains the heights of past entries and adds a few tweaks. The battle system has a lot of diversity and customization to it. In terms of stats and classes, every character can be customized as you like. Tactical battles are one of the series' strong points and one that is still true for this entry. Conquering these fights has a great taste of satisfaction no matter how easy they can get but, the harder the more rewarding.

Three Houses is not only tactic battles, that is just one of the sides of this multilayered work. I'd like to think that is more like three games in one: tactical warfare, dating simulator, and teacher simulator, although the latter is more like a bridge between battles and dating, it still comes with its complex systems.

The dating sim and teacher sim are not as polished as their battle counterpart, but they're pretty enjoyable nonetheless. Your time within the game is divided by a monthly schedule. Exploring the monastery is the most ""dating"" part of the game and while it's pretty basic it has a lot of charm to it.

Defining difficulty in Three Houses is nebulous, overall is OK with a tendency to the easier side even in hard, but there's a game-breaking element newly introduced to this game: Divine Pulse. This mechanic consists of rewinding time in battle, meaning that if you make a wrong turn and get yourself or a unit killed, you can rewind time as far as you want, at first you can only redo time a couple of times, but you can get 13 recharges at the end of the game. The problem with Divine Pulse is that it makes stakes non-existent, It also can make your strategies lazier, considering you can redo time at any time not only when a unit dies.

I got mixed feelings towards the main campaigns overall. To some degree, depending on which house you choose, the events will unfold entirely differently in the middle of each route. My first campaign took me around 100 hours to finish, I didn't go full completionist, but I did a lot of stuff in the meantime. Even if you're rushing through, I imagine they will be still pretty lengthy nonetheless, so if you're planning to beat this game only once you better choose carefully which house you prefer the most, considering that each story has different values, and in my opinion, at least one is inferior to the other two by a considerable amount, it would not only impact the story you'll get, but also the enjoyment you will get from the game.

Getting back to the main paths, you can have a different experience depending on what you choose, if you're planning to play the three main paths then this won't be a problem, although, now that I know what I know, I would prefer to do the paths in another order to get a better experience. Each path offers not only different events and endings but also have a theme that represents a little the struggles of its protagonist and class.

Setting aside the things I dislike are nitpicks in comparison to the good ones, for what it's worth, Fire Emblem Three Houses is a massive experience and goes well beyond what a video game could offer from other media. The fact that three people could play this game and have three different massive experiences blows me away. I'm not saying that other games don't offer this kind of experience, after all, a lot of modern games have this ""your decisions"" matters structure, however, Three Houses is a beast of its own and it blurs the line of what replayability means."

Did I spend over 100 hours on it ? Definitely. Does it mean I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed older games ? Definitely not.

The exploration phases in the Monastery are pretty weird and grindy. The fights are generally not really difficult or interesting (bar some of the side chapters involving two characters).
The recruitement is boring at best (just give flowers to the person you are willing to recruit. Give them more flowers. Some fish maybe. And you're done).
Improving your allies' weapon rank is also boring (although the class mechanics seemed fun at first, it doesn't really do well in the long run). Also I must say that I'm a bit frustrated at the fact that ""anyone could be anything"".

Although I appreciate the fact that Intelligent Systems has created several routes for the games, most ofthe content is actually very similar, on the same maps with very little twists.
The combat mechanics seem rusty and less polished than they were on the former docked console games (Radiant Dawn / Path of Radiance). I mean, did anybody really give a fudge about the soldiers accompanying the heroes ?

It is a tactics RPG in the long lived Fire Emblem IP. As such, it's good enough. It just doesn't fly as high as others to me."

He visto muchas críticas que tratan la supuesta pérdida de esencia de la saga Fire Emblem en este título... Desde mi más humilde opinión... Pamplinas, lo único que de verdad diferenciaba a la saga Fire Emblem de otras del mismo género, no era su estética o sus historias sobre la guerra... bla bla bla, seamos sinceros ninguna entrega de la saga tiene una historia que te rompa la cabeza, ni falta que le hace, la gracia de la saga son sus personajes, es esa mecánica que tantos reseteos nos ha costado a muchos, estoy hablando de la muerte permanente. Cuando un personaje muere... no va al centro pokemon, muere y punto, a diferencia de otras sagas com Advance War, los personajes no son meros peones/carne de cañón fácilmente reemplazables, es por esto que lo más importante en esta saga son sin dudas sus personajes, que es lo que te hace luchar y romperte la cabeza en sus niveles muy bien pensados... efectivamente, bien pensados, son lo suficientemente accesibles como para dar un buen sabor de boca en normal y lo suficientemente bien diseñados como para ser un desafío absolutamente titánico en dificultades superiores. Pero no nos desviemos, volvamos a los personajes, sinceramente creo que es el juego de la saga con los mejores personajes, no vas a empatizar más con ellos en ningún otro juego de la saga. Y su historia no es su punto flojo, no sorprende demasiado, pero es posiblemente la que mejor lleve el tema de la guerra, aquí no hay un malo maloso ni un héroe... eso solo es así... si solo has jugado 1 de las 5 historias que trae este juego... has oído bien, 5, dos de ellas ""contadas desde el mismo punto de vista"" y otra disponible a partir de DLC
Sin lugar a dudas para mi es el mejor juego que uno puede encontrarse en la switch, no se lleva el 10 por sus relativamente frecuentes caídas de frames en el monasterio, por lo demás, un buen rpg táctico, bien balanceado y con un diseño de niveles justo pero desafiante, una banda sonora espectacular, una misma historia decente y contada desde varios puntos de vista con sus diferentes opiniones y por supuesto un elenco de personajes BRUTAL que te hará protegerlos aunque te cueste tu salud mental."

  ",9,"Excellent game and my personal game of the year of 2019. The music. the narrative, the content, how fun it is, it's all there. This game got me into Fire Emblem. What I love most about the Fire Emblem games is how much the gameplay reminds me of chess. All 4 paths were pretty good, Blue Lions being my favorite and arguably the best one. The church route felt kind of rushed and was the least memorable to me. My second favorite is the Black Eagles route. And Golden Deer taking 3rd place. I liked the Golden Deer route but towards the end that also felt kind of rushed. I clocked in about 200 hours beating all the routes.

The character bonds you forge in this one are great and actually feel important too. It actually shapes the characters into who they are. It can also determine which character is going to marry who when you beat the game.

What really made me fall in love with the game was the amount of interacting you can do with the characters as well as how beautifully crafted the music is. The music fits whatever is happening in the story so well, I haven't seen a game make the music fit the narrative this well since Undertale. A plus about this game too is it isn't too hard. I found the balance on normal classic to be perfect.

I paid full price for this one and will gladly buy it again for full price if I could. If you own a switch you have to give it a try."

  ",10,"As someone new to both SRPGs and the Fire Emblem series, I was surprised how immediately hooked I became after the first few hours. I thought that meticulous planning before each battle would feel like a burden (I'm not usually a fan of menus upon menus in RPGs), but I was wrong. This might be my favorite Switch game, behind only BOTW.

As the professor of one of three houses, you start to care so much for each of your students and become invested in  their stories. Battles just feel more personal, because these are YOUR students, and you want them to bond as a team and grow individually. The story is one of the deepest and most interesting you can find on Switch, and battles are still fun (after logging 60+ hours). I never replay games, ever, but I can't wait to finish the game with my first house (I chose Blue Lions) so that I can start on the next one!"

This was my first Fire Emblem game and man oh man, did I enjoy it. There are pretty much two parts to the game (there are some others too, but they are smaller and fit cleanly into one of the two categories): there’s the walking around the hub world and there are the battles. Those two different parts of gameplay are tied together by a phenomenal story, with twists and turns that would make M. Night Shyamalan blush. The characters are compelling; they’ll make you laugh, they’ll make you cry, and every word of dialogue is voice acted with the most talented actors and actresses you’ll ever hear (in English, at least; haven’t played any other version). The battles are steeped in strategy that will give you a headache to keep up with at first, but by the end you’re so satisfied you’ve figured it out. Game of the year, every year, forever and ever."

  ",8,"Pros:
- Artistic improvements and content such as visuals, UI, different paths and combat system.
- Good story! It becomes engaging from the very beginning but it doesn't have a significant climax (Golden Deer Path). The path system adds a lot of replay value.
- Excellent gameplay, easy to play and master. It really is a ""Master class in war"" as it says on the game box.

Cons:
- Compared to the 3DS titles, the story is not as powerful as it used to be.
- Shallow character development. The absence of the marriage systems affects the depth of classmates's relationships.
- Some plot holes like Sothis' role affect the story. Poorly explained rewind feature, but useful.
- Overlapping animations. They should have put more effort in the main characters at least.

Final Thoughts:
A great game overall! It doesn't disappoint at all. I will definitely play another path to give it a second chance because the story lacks of a effective climax. The developer should have put more effort in the character animations and development."

  ",0,"I like the Fire Emblem franchise so I decided to give this one a try out of sheer covid boredom. If you do not like anime aesthetics, or tropes when it comes to story telling and characters, give this one a pass. I understand that they are going for a Harry Potter thing with the three houses and all. But it makes zero sense to send young literally children out into war to be killed (not to mention everyone being so casual about it).

The characters are very stereotypical and predictable, you have your awkward shy emo girl who self quarantines even though there’s no pandemic and so on. The male characters are pretty much all this Japanese male ideal of being very thin and effeminate, which is fine it’s just a bit jarring as a westener.

If you are Gen Z, and/or a weeb, you will love this game. Otherwise you will probably hate it like I do. It’s sad because the standard Fire Emblem tactical gameplay is fine, if only you didn’t have to deal with the chore of the dating sim/visual novel **** John Carmack said it best: ”Video games need a story just as much as a porn movie does”. I wish I could refund this but alas."

  ",9,"After my 300+ hours of playing, it becomes apparent how masterfully crafted Fire Emblem Three Houses is.

The good: Gameplay has been refined with an improved and intuitive user-interface. Voice acting is professionally done and well executed. The overall narrative is deep and interconnected, thus rewarding repeat playthroughs. Each character is unique in terms of personality and stats, thus creating a more personal and customizable journey. Cutscenes display a great degree of quality. Music is varied, with strong contrasts between Rain and Storm versions of songs during combat. The Divine Pulse quick reset feature is a wonderful quality of life mechanic. Delivering the game's themes with morally ambiguous characters added a sense of realism and intelligence to the game - there is not always a clear good or bad guy.  Each of the game's paths tell a distinct story, be it of redemption, acceptance, or self-deliverance. Developers nailed the medieval monastery theme, creating a grounded and believable sense of worldbuilding.

The bad: Many of the maps are stale, simple, and reused, thus making repeat combats less enjoyable and strategic."

Quitemos del camino lo peor del juego: su apartado técnico.

En ocasiones se ve como juego de hace 10 años; texturas horribles, escenarios estériles, slowdown y demás. Es un juego que visualmente es ""aceptable"", pero que en sus peores momentos se ve bastante mediocre.

Ya entrando en materia de lo jugable, sus sistemas y mecánicas, tenemos una de las entregas más finas de la serie. La novedad principal es la ambientación escolar y que ahora todo está regido por un calendario.

A fin de mes siempre hay una gran misión y tenemos varias semanas para prepararnos. Podemos llevar a cabo actividades sociales que beben de otros juegos de simulación social, para poco a poco ir fortaleciendo las relaciones entre personajes y su efectividad al pelear juntos.

Al momento de las batallas todo es muy similar, pero hay cambios en los sistemas de habilidades y magias que hacen que el juego se sienta único. También tenemos un sistema de batallones que se pueden equipar a las unidades, lo que agrega una capa extra de personalización.

Si eres fan de Fire Emblem estás ante una de sus entradas más solidas. Con un trama muy buena de múltiples ramificaciones, una colección entrañable de personajes y un sistema de juego delicioso y adictivo. Aunque en algunos apartados quede debiendo."

Although the routes don't have enough unique aspects to justify playing through all four for anyone but the most dedicated fans, I think they do a great job of encouraging discussion about the game. It's really interesting to see the different perspectives of people who played the Blue Lions route vs. those who did the Black Eagles route, for example.
I was disappointed to see Intelligent Systems ditch Hidari for character designs after how great Shadows of Valentia looked, but aside from that this game gave me a lot of hope for the future of the series."

I love the whole school setting and the soundtrack is so good I listen to it in my car all the time. The graphics are very anime but also very timeless looking and the story is definitely in the top 5 FE games.

The plot and characters are nowhere near as great as FE4, 5, 7  or Path of Radiance, but there's a lot to like. My biggest gripe with the plot is that certain interesting characters die way too soon. There are 4 story paths and I've only finished the Red and Blue ones but I was engaged and wanting to see where it went.

  ",9,"Me compré la Switch más por el zelda y el Odyssey y este ha acabado siendo mi juego favorito de la consola hasta el momento. La historia atrapa desde el principio, y el estilo de combate por turnos, algo que me echaba para atrás en principio, me ha encantado. Los personajes son muy carismáticos salvo el protagonista (aunque hay motivo para ello). Es un juego realmente largo, pasarse cada casa debe llevar facilmente más de 50 horas y hay 3 (con la expansión 4). Yo le he metido más de 130 horas y aún estoy por la tercera casa. Hay que decir que una de ellas tiene dos ramas, según tomes cierta decisión.
Lo único que me ha gustado menos es el tiempo que hechas en la escuela, a veces se hace algo pesado tener que estar haciendo recados tontos como encontrar objetos y tal, sobretodo cuando los personajes no tienen nada que contarte, aún así hay bastantes cosas que hacer, como dedicarlas a combatir en misiones secundarias, dar clases extras o simplemente darte una vuelta.
+Personajes, molan todos y cada uno de ellos, son profundos, aunque en un principio no lo parezcan y dan ganas de conocerlos.
+Historia y Lore, muy interesantes
+Duración, más de 150 horas facilmente pasártelo con cada una de las casas.
+Combates, muy profundas y a veces exigentes, sobretodo en máxima dificultad y con las muertes permanentes activadas.
+Clases de personajes y su desarrollo gracias a las clases, batallas, etc.
-El tiempo dentro del castillo, a veces se hace un poco pesado, aunque puedes elegir hacer otras cosas en vez de dar vueltas, pero aún así habría metido alguna opción más.
-El protagonista es anticarismático, aunque como digo más arriba tiene una razón argumental.
-La primera mitad del camino argumental de cada casa, la historia cambia poco entre ellas, a partir de la segunda mitad es cuando cambian de verdad."

I liked the story, i liked the mechanics...

But this game is completely out of tone :
You're a teacher managing students...

Okay... I think King Marth would have appreciate a brighter tone.

But you can still romance... Come on, some of them are 17 y-o !
The relationship teacher-student is illegal in some countries where this game is sold !

The story is not bad, but too predictable...

The graphism and sountrack can be better, but not atrocious.

Some functionality are fun but the game as a whole is too easy compared to his ancestors, some battle mechanics have disappeared.

Maybe my nostalgia of better Fire Emblem games makes me a grumpy ,

Maybe it's a cool way to get a new public to the game (all the Waifu-ers or Anime fans) and maybe uncle Nintendo will remaster his oldies to make everybody happy."

The story caught me from start to finish. The different routes and their differences in history are great, giving you to understand that there are no good or bad, all with their ideals and motivations. It is difficult not to be attached to your students and suffer later when time passes in history. The music transmits a lot, it is great. And although it loses graphically and technically, and its gameplay is tedious at school, in the end you get used to everything because of the excellence of the rest of the game.

  ",10,"This is pretty much my first fire emblem game outside of playing fire emblem blazing blade on gba for about an hour before putting it down. At first I wasn't into three houses because of the monastery sections as playing all these mini games and running around talking to people etc was pretty boring. However, once I really dug in and gave it a chance, I was hooked and I would say now I'm even having fun running around trying to find all the items, raise support with my students, and generally be as efficient as possible. Certain things like fishing are still tedious however and make the game less replayable. For me, there could be improvements in certain areas like better end game class balance/diversity and making the students/units feel more unique. And despite it being a series staple, I'm not entirely sold on the idea of permadeath as pretty much any unit dying of yours is a reset, although divine pulse is a clever solution here. Overall, three houses is addicting fun once so I have to give it a 10. Looking forward to finishing my GD hard run and then playing through the BE route on maddening."

Unless you  take the Black Eagle route, the others are basically identical just with different units available and the fates of one or two other characters altered.

Gameplay is amazing, story is awesome, music is great (not as great as awakening thought imho). the fact that the weapons break is actually a great mechanics that i think should have been added long ago.
i wish it had more relationship iterations, like the past fire emblems. And the fact that after playing all the storyline i still haven't found something that would agree with me.

There are multiple routes and was a blast to see them all, I noticed most of the routes had a little too much in common, but It never took me out of the experience. It plays like a tactics game and a JRPG but It blends them in really well. There's not a whole lot to not like here, but there is a few worth mentioning.
You get to make a lot of choices but most of them except for which house you pick in the beginning and a certain choice you have to make in the black eagles route that I won't spoil, are really the only choices that affect the story, I still had fun and didn't even really notice until much later, but it's definitely worth mentioning.
The DLCs weren't too great either, and I really hate it the last one, but I had to finish it so I could add a few characters to the main story, those characters are also very likable just not the side story in which you first meet them in.
Other than those complaints this game is phenomenal and it's definitely one of the best I've ever played.

Further the tutorial is lacking and the in game documentation too. The learning curve at least for newcomers will therefore be relatively high.

Other than that it is a very nice game so far. Currently around 15 hours in. The characters have a lot of personality and the longer the game goes on the more you are going to care about them. The things you can do between battle missions by exploring the monastery, talking to people, catch fish, grow plants and so on are a welcoming change. The strategic part of the game is demanding if you play the game on the hard difficulty. I chose to play in classic mode which means that if someone in battle dies he will be dead for good. However because you have a time turner to your availability that lets you go back up to 3 turns this is not such a big challenge. Up until now I haven‘t lost anyone.

If they would make the texts better readable in handheld mode I would give the game a 9 out of 10."

  ",10,"Uno de los mejores Fire Emblem y una pequeña evolución en la saga. Toma la idea de los múltiples caminos de FE Fates, pero bien llevada a cabo (y en el mismo cartucho). Continua incluyendo elementos que no me resultan favorables pero sé que tienen su fanbase (como las horas del té) pero también ha sido bien llevado y no resulta molesto.
La libertad y posibilidad de desarrollo de los personajes es enorme, y esta bien llevado en el sentido de que, aunque puedes volver a cualquier personaje en casi cualquier clase, hay ciertas que son más aptas para cada uno (tanto por personalidad como por estadísticas, aunque hay algunos con los que puedes experimentar bastante). Los personajes son también interesantes mayormente.
Las diferentes lineas de la historia son interesantes (algunas más que otras), y jugar por múltiples caminos te da más detalles globales de ella, pero siendo todos los caminos igual de verdaderos.
La dinámica de explorar la base es genial, sobre todo al principio, pero pierde cierta importancia hacía el final, cuando has maximizado muchas de las cosas que puedes hacer (y es puramente opcional si alguien quiere solo batallar).
La dificultad del juego tiende hacia lo fácil en el modo normal, pudiendo levelear todo lo que quieras entre misiones, siendo genial para primerizos en la saga o gente que prefiera una experiencia diferente a la clásica de los FE. El modo difícil quita esta dinámica y es una experiencia más FE.
Como puntos negativos, alguna mecánica de la base puede ser algo repetitiva sobre todo al comienzo del juego (la pesca...)

  ",10,"Before I started this game, Monster Hunter was the game that kept me playing in excess of 200 hours per game. I couldn't imagine any other game which could match the MH series. Enter Fire Emblem: Three Houses. I have clocked nearly the 300 hour mark (including 4 playthroughs - I won't put spoilers here but you'll find out - of the main game and a playthrough of the DLC) and all this is because of the combination of riveting stories and excellent gameplay. The Fire Emblem series is based on its turn-based, tactical and addictive gameplay.

The reason we kept coming back for more is the outcomes of relationships between members, the multiple divergent paths you can take, and the diverse number of characters you can battle with, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  The difficulty level is completely up to you. You can play super-hard and have perma-death on your characters, or you can play on casual and have any dead characters mercifully revived in the next mission.

The story is so well written, and the in-game animation during the ""exploration"" days in the monastery is utterly beautiful. There are so many things to do during exploration too, so it's not just a tactical turned-base game. This is hands-down the most unique, most beautiful game (characters especially) and character-driven Fire Emblem of all Fire Emblems. I cannot recommend enough of this game. It really caught me unaware how the game never grows old despite multiple playthroughs, because it feels different in each playthrough.

I highly recommend this - well worth the money paid for both the main game and the DLC."

Story might not be groundbreaking, but it's still very good, gameplay is enjoyable, and characters are really fun to get to know better through the Support conversations. I certainly also enjoy that none of the sides is entirely ""good"" one, something you notice if you play more than just one campaign(Talking especially to people who played only Blue Lions route... which I personally consider worst of four possible endings).

I would give it a 9/10, however I can't help but notice that the game seems somewhat... ""sanitized"" in development, possibly to avoid offending certain easily offended scumbags who pretend to play games while in reality just being bunch of political activist whiners. For example, there is an odd lack of swimsuit or even towel outfits, which were usually available in Fire Emblem, even though the game has a Sauna, which should be more than enough of a reason for characters to wear towels... but instead they seem to wear really out of place looking potato sack outfits...

I found this one to be way more fun (probably because I don't have so much experience with the franchise). The first play through I found to be awesome, however currently on my second play through with dlc, and I got to say,   going through the story again feels like crawling through mud. I know there's the option to essentially skip months and have choices chosen for you, but I kind of wish there was an endless mode for those who want to keep playing with the character's they've invested so much into. Maybe there is a mode like this after the story and I'm missing something(?)

Another minor thing is that with a lot of player-controlled characters and enemies on the field, battles can last a good long while. But I guess that's to be expected/obvious as the more people you have to control, if you're thinking about the best moves to make, as a whole the battle will naturally take more time. Of course you could just ignore a few or all of the other characters, but in harder difficulties you kind of have to use everything at your disposal.

  ",4,"I played through the entire game. It is such a shame that this game decides to give you 1/5th **** in a 50 hours+ playthrough. Such a tedious, repetitive, frustrating, waste of time. It is impossible to enjoy the game because every time something interesting happens, it's always like ""we'll maybe explain it in a future playthrough or paid DLC."" The result is an empty, soulless experience where it's impossible to be emotionally invested in anything.

During your first playthrough, you will have no idea what is going on. It's hard to put into words just how poorly the story is presented. 95% of your dialog options go like this:

""I am person X from place Y.""

A: ""Person X?""
B: ""Place Y?""

NPC Answer: The same no matter what you pick.

There are maybe 2 choices that actually matter, though there are few that seem huge and yet turn out to be completely meaningless:

""Will you be my ally or my enemy?""

A: Ally
B: Enemy

NPC Answer: Ok, we will be enemies regardless of what you pick.

The player has no control over any interaction. Half-way through you will be asked to pick a side in a war where nobody explains why they are fighting or tries to convince you in any way. You will have 0 context for this decision. That is the biggest choice in the game. Even after finishing the game, I don't understand why we were fighting. I guess I can play through 5 more times to find out!

The relationship building system is also terrible. Characters will bond and trigger various cut-scenes. Half of them will be fights where the characters clearly hate each other, so it's weird to call it bonding but OK. Characters have 1 personality trait and all interactions revolve around that. The last cut-scene will largely be the characters asking other characters to consider marrying them. One character will propose to like 4-5 different people, it's so weird. At the very end, you will get a text box telling you that certain characters got married, which seems entirely random and no one really knows the formula. All my end pairings were between people I consider incompatible. The player's own marriage is awkward and sterile. And of course, lots of characters will seem to be in love with you before the last battle, because there is only one path for each relationship and all paths that can end in marriage, end in marriage. There aren't many. 3-4 very short conversations with each character.

This was my First fire Emblem game and yeah, I hate it. I don't understand what people find appealing about this mess. The music is terrible. The player character aesthetic, ugh. The empty coat sleeves flailing about, the fishnets with holes, the open fly, the floating collar, the green hair. It's everything that's ever been wrong about JRPGs. No customization, silent cardboard protagonist, grindy, bizarre color and style choices, tries to draw inspiration from medieval Europe but ends up just making everything weird."

  ",10,"I wish I could rate this game higher than 10. I've thrown more than 400 hours into this game and am not sick of it still. I finish playing through a route and immediately feel tempted to start a new one. The Tactics-gameplay is well thought out and satisfying, while giving many opportunities for customizing your units and making each run-through different. Want to make your whole army fliers? You can (and probably should) do that. Looking at a mage and think he should be a physical based class instead this time? Go right ahead, no restrictions outside of a few gender-exclusive classes.

The characters, amazing. Even the ones I ""dislike"" are still really fleshed out and well-acted by the English voice cast, very few of which I was familiar with prior to 3H but I certainly am now.

The overarching plot? Incredible! There's no true ""good"" or ""bad"" choice, because all sides truly have a good point, which makes it all the more intriguing. The different routes, too, make for a ton of replay-value since you're not getting the same thing every time.

...tldr, this game is absolutely incredible. If it was the kind of game where graphics mattered at all I might have given it a 9/10 but... they really don't, not for this title. It may not be the prettiest game around but I've got absolutely no issue staring at it for hundreds of hours, apparently. Even then, I bet that if this game had been made for a more powerful console like the Xbox One, even that wouldn't have been an issue. The prerendered cutscenes are breathtaking, I think the in-game stuff is partially hardware constraints, but probably mostly a need to focus efforts on more important aspects of the game.

But yeah. 15/10 if I could. I plan to spend many many MORE hours with it."

But turns out that it's shallow and easy with no real tactical depth. Even Mario and Rabbits has much more depth and variety to combat not to mention Wasteland 2, Divinity 2 and other masterpieces available on switch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is not long time JRPG fan and already got used to it. Super basic overworld, purly animated and waitless feel of main character (like they used some basic free Unity3d template to create it), invisible walls, NPCs glued to places, long fetch quests not even as a side ones, but in main storyline, clunky controls and UI etc"

  ",5,"After completing the game first time, I understood the new fresh ideas the developers introduced for the series, but those ideas did not click with me. I'm not a fan of the character design, level design, multiple endings and routes, school setting, unit management and how the narrative is told.

Further to this, the first 20 hours are extremely easy, having played on normal difficulty with classic settings with almost every unit winning with a critical hit.

I also have an issue with the main character Byleth. Being that the character is mute during story scenes, but has a voice actor. Added to that every other character calls him/her 'professor' instead of using his/her name. With that in mind, why could we not name the character ourselves? It suggests that the developers were going to include character creation into the game (similar to FE: Awakening), but gave up on the idea.

Overall this is the worst fire emblem game I've ever played and I prefer previous entries, such as Sacred Stones and Shadows of Valentia."

  ",8,"Don't get me wrong: this game is very good. All the reviews above attest that.
But let me talk about the flaws - some so obvious that it's really incredible Nintendo haven't added a free DLC to ""patch"" them already (there is not even a payd DLC to remedy this):

- Classes: The classes ****. It starts ok with the most basic classes evolving to the intermediate ones. Their progress make sense, although the habilities and requiremets to do so are a liitle to be contested. Then comes the Advanced and the dreaded Master classes - that really ****.
And they **** because Master classes are really limited, not innovative, and are sex dependant - some classes are only available for men, some only for woman. Raised a gal to be a powerful magician? Good for you! But good luck trying to find a master class for Hannemann, or Linhardt. You'll find yourself trying to level up habilities that are very unnatural to them just so you can make them better fighters.
A DLC, or even an update with more classes not only would make FETH much more replayable, but also add a lot in terms of strategy and character planning.

- Maps: although fairly different between them, there are not a lot of maps on the main game. You´ll find yourself fighting on the same maps over and over again. That changes a little bit on the main quest but the side quests always recycle the boring maps. And that fog of war gimmick is really underexplored - maybe 2, 3 maps used it. Sell all your torches.

- The animations are kinda too poor and the character stories are repetitive, stereotipical. There is a lot of character content, which makes the game a little too ""visual novel"", but they do not add too much in character development or charisma.

- Exploring the Monasterium gets old and boring very quickly. The quests are repetitive and do not add much to the game, nor the story, nor the fun. Fishing minigame is a joke.

- Combat is fun. Some maps are not. Managing Battalions is not fun at all.

Again, it's still a good game, although not the best FE of the series at all. But the FE debut on the Switch could be better, and it's not too late to fix this."

The only other fire emblem I've played is the demo for awakening on 3ds which I also enjoyed but I never got around to playing the full game, and as I am writing this review it has been a day since I beat my first run of the game with 28 and a half hours, though I have already started a new run of the game. What i enjoyed most outside of the core game-play which is a mix of being a professor and teaching class and running around the monastery doing things like returning lost items and entering 1-1 tournaments for special rewards and battles which from an outside perspective play like most other fire emblem games, is the fully voice acted story line which in my experience at least doesn't drag out longer then it should and has great characters and goes in a really interesting direction at least on my run of the game. The presentation is great asides from the really muddy and low-res textures on the environments which make it look like a 3ds game and is the reason this game isn't a 10 for me, asides from that though the actual characters look great and the music and voice acting(for the most part and in comparison to other recent jrpgs like dq11) is incredible.

+ Great Combat animations, Incredible voice cast

The bad
- Map design sometimes encourages the use of Divine Pulse, a feature many veterans refuse to use. Having Pegasus Knight spawn into your face after your turn end, or a certain move triggering all enemies to advance to you of a sudden is simply not good difficulty design
- (On Maddening), Pegasus Knights are most OP enemies in the entire game, without proper preparation from the very beginning it might be unplayable later on

  ",4,"There’s so much to say about this game, but it really all boils down to it having some really shining moments that dissipate due to the games extended 40+ hour duration.

In the first 10 hours, I was loving everything about this game! The monastery stuff was engaging and the combat was new and complex in its own way. After that, the gameplay loop started to rapidly become repetitive and I found myself trying to skip through the game's systems in the most time-efficient way possible.

Characters and Story:

This is my first fire emblem game, so I obviously did not have any context for the world or characters, so the entire story and lore were very skippable.

Is it just me or were there only like 4 good characters in the whole story? I went Empire and personalities like Bernadetta, Ferdinand, Dorothea, Casper, and even your dad were so one dimensional that there was never a good connection with any of them. The relevance of any of the students seemed abysmal, and they simply followed your every move regardless of its morals. I feel like the students (besides them being your fighting party) are there just to be a showcase of different waifus.

Even Byleth is a boring clean-slate character because the game refuses to give the player choices with how they approach the other characters in the world. You only get to make a few major story decisions, but it ends there.

Combat:

From the first fight, I thought this game would function better if standard party sizes were smaller by default. Having 10+ people in your party makes inventory management a nightmare and having a connection to your party members abysmal. I found myself navigating the inventory before a random auxiliary battle for 15 minutes, just trying to sell junk. I feel that having a full school of characters but only being able to choose 5 or 6 of them depending on the mission would’ve been a really interesting way to give the player more strategy and decision in how they choose to play.

With this as my first Fire Emblem game, I chose Normal difficulty not knowing what to expect. With so many people in your party, the game was a breeze on normal. I’d probably have a better time on hard. I wish there was an option to switch difficulty on a save file from Normal to Hard.

Also, why did they introduce the fog mechanic early on then never bring it back anywhere in the game? Are there fog levels on harder difficulties?

The combat lacks variety in how to play. I felt like all characters were locked into whatever their specialty was from start to finish because it’s such a difficult task to reclass a character with prebuilt strengths.

Waifus:

The payoff for who you marry does not feel earned or satisfied at all. Also, the way they handle all the character's stories at the end of the game felt lazy.

  ",5,"I am a hundred hours in played every route so I could give a solid opinion on this game. verdict;
This is a mediocre Fire Emblem title at best, is it enjoyable yes, but it could have been FAR better.

Anyone who has ever played a classic Fire Emblem game knows this title does not hold up to it's name. I have played all 3 routes with decent enjoyment. but the flaws of 3 houses become more visible with each play through. I actively get less enjoyment the more I play it. due to the ungodly amount of ""filler"" between each Chapter.

At it's core a Fire Emblem game consists of 3 main aspects:
Strategy
Fast and Eyecandy Combat visuals
Engaging Characters

These criteria are all met. but due to a lot of dragged out ""filler"" material it takes ages to get to those parts. Yes I am indeed calling the Hubworld ""Filler"". The month of prep-time between each mission is gruelingly long and it only gets longer with each play through. I am wasting time, tending to my garden, feeding my soldiers (which you can only do 2 at a time!), doing faculty training and fishing!

I did not pick up a STRATEGY game to play a fishing simulator!

Even the Auxiliary Battle's are basicly just level grinders to stretch out the game.
Paralogues are the only parts that get a pass because they are basically bonus chapters for the story of the game. a story that I can only play once every ingame month.

The other aspect of this game that has not been thought through is it's class system.
I am quite positive about the idea of being able to train your soldiers in any way you see fit.
despite a characters Pro's or Con's. but Half of the class's do not have a natural progression into their next stage. ""Hero"", ""Assassin"" and ""Pegasus Knight"" are a few notable examples. these classes have NO follow-up in their respective tree which is just a kick in your face to discover halfway. because now you have to abandon all your hard work and retrain their neglected aspects to make them useful again.

This game also Bombards you with Characters, Classes and Dialogue;
It is a fun gimmick to give your main character a class to run and have them be your students.
but to instantly get bombarded with an entire school of characters just ruins the experience of really getting to know your team. the appeal of building up a team, and getting to know the characters and their class is completely lost and dis-attache's you from them. instead it's boom ! Pick a class of 10 random characters you know nothing about with a 10 mile text-crawls to learn the details of how to play the game. If you're a first time player of Fire Emblem I find this a highly un-appealing way to learn the game.

Which also ties in to the overload of support conversations
I get that every character needs to have support convo's with every character.
with there are simply to many!, I don't mind listening to 1 or 2 convo's between chapters to hear what my team is doing. but when I finish a mission and I have to go through over 10 conversations every single time it just **** the motivation out of you, with a lot of them treading the same ground it just becomes more ""Filler"" I don't want to feel like skipping the support conversations. but when you reach your third play through all you wanna do is get it over with so you can get to your mission!. to the actual story and gameplay!

Cut out the Hubworld!
Cut out the Auxiliary Battles!
Cut out the Seminars!
Give every character a maximum of 10 possible support convo's per playthrough!

And you'd have a Really Decent Fire Emblem Game. worth at least a 7.5
in it's current state. A 5 at best."

I beat it on casual once, almost on hard (made it all the way to enbarr and got stuck because it put my death knight killer on the wrong side of the map) once, and hopefully on hard this run.  I hope to do maddening on my 4th.

The characters are largely fun, with a few being one dimensional and boring but that's par for the course for this genre.  With well over a dozen characters you're not going to like everyone.

I enjoyed the story more than awakenings, and something something dragons something something.  If you've played a fire emblem game you know what I mean.

The mechanics are hard to judge because I am complete trash at turn based combat games like this.  I didn't even realize you could swap out abilities until my second run.  Maybe it's difficult, maybe it isn't.  Play it and find out for yourself."

If you do something during a battle that the game doesn't want you/ didn't expect you to do, the game autocorrects with some rather annoying deus ex machina tactics like if you kill a boss that you weren't supposed to be able to kill, the game may spawn powerful enemies around your one vital party member and the next thing you know, the 1 hour+ battle you just went through needs to be completely started over. This isn't always avoidable either. Sometimes reinforcements spawn around vital party member just because you weren't psychic enough to know exactly where their reinforcements would appear.

  ",9,"One of the best JRPG's on Switch, and a must-own for fans of the genre. Fire Emblem: Three Houses, released on July 26th of 2019, marks yet another new beginning for the storied Nintendo franchise after the renaissance it had already experienced with 2013's Fire Emblem Awakening, both refining and polishing already existing mechanics while making other interesting additions to the typical strategy formula in the same way that Gaiden and its 3DS remake, Echoes: Shadows of Valentia did.
Overall, Fire Emblem: Three Houses provides dozens of hours of addicting tactics, lovable characters, a brilliant soundtrack that puts more of an electronic tinge on the typical orchestral scores, and a serviceable story split up into three/four diverging routes. Many negative reviews designed to lower the game's score will tell you this game isn't a real Fire Emblem, or that it's characters and story is boring and it's gameplay basic, or even giving it 0's based on comparisons to another series that bears social sim mechanics, the Persona series; it is advised to ignore these reviews. A game should never be judged on any merits other than it's own, and for all this game provides, it is an amazing experience.
One downside, inevitably comes with the visuals. Although visuals will almost never dock a point in our scores, the graphical fidelity of Fire Emblem: Three Houses ranges from passable to embarrassing. Dimitri's tunic, one of the three house leaders, is completely pixelated, some textures are muddy or blurry and the clouds the player sees when roaming the monastery look like they came out of a Super Nintendo or Game Boy Advance. Other than that, the game excels in everything it sets out to do.
It took us nearly sixty hours to clear our first route, the Golden Deer route, and upon inspecting New Game + with the Blue Lions, there are large swaths of content unique to each route that combined may add up to 120 hours of unique content depending on what you choose to do on the off-days that the in-game calendar gives to you.
This is a strong recommend, and a must-own game for Nintendo Switch. There is a reason the Fire Emblem community banded together for this entry, and it is gaining so much attention. Fire Emblem: Three Houses won Strategy Game of the Year and Player's Choice (the true Game of the Year), the only categories it was nominated in at The Game Awards 2019, and likely would have won more had there been a more diverse and fair jury selecting the nominees. It would likely go down as an all-time classic had the visuals not brought it down for many, and although some may have their nit-picks, there is no denying that Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a stellar title.

  ",10,"Three Houses marks the return of Fire Emblem to a main line console. The last entry on a home console was Radiant Dawn on Wii and before that, Path of Radiance on Gamecube.

So how did it fare? Pretty well. Fire Emblem saw a resurgence in popularity after the 3DS title Awakening and has since gone form strength to strength bolstered by it's presence in Smash Bros.

Three Houses ditched the three different versions that Fire Emblem Fates had with Birthright, Conquest and Revelations. Instead it opted for one game with three branching paths based on which house you chose.

There is a lot of replay value here to be sure. Many of the core tenants from the series carry over like support conversations and yes even romance and marriage for a given pairing. Though they have scaled back in that only the main protagonist and one of their choosing can marry and gone are the offspring that can then be recruited into child soldiers.

Now you can hire battalions to aid you in battle and the gameplay remains much the same. There are a few new mechanics here or there. But generally speaking if you have played Fire Emblem before you will know what to expect.

The Monastery of Gareg Mach is where you spend much of your time as it serves as a hub with many activities to engage in. You can teach your students, partake in cooking, etc. All of this goes toward increasing skills. It's a novel approach and it works well. After a time skip it becomes your headquarters of sorts.

All the dialogue is fully voiced and the actors really commit themselves to their roles here. I didn't really find any cringe inducing lines of dialogue that I can think of. It's an enjoyable story too.

Easily one of the Switch's best."

I haven't finished the game yet, having played around 40 hours in 5 days, but I absolutely love this game. It's extremely addicting with lots of variety and replayability to explore the various houses and action choices throughout the campaign. It's a huge game with deep customization and just enough randomness to keep things interesting but fair.

I have found the characters and storyline to be far more engaging than in both Awakening and Fates, the two previous entries that I played. I am far more invested in the teaching Academy aspect than I expected to be.

My only complaints would be that hard difficulty is a bit easy if you do even a little bit of optimization of your time. Also that the UI is bad with regards to inventory management."

  ",10,"First Fire Emblem I ever played. Bought it on a whim when I was looking for something new to play back in September. Put 200+ hours in and still had yet to completely finish all possible routes. Game has a satisfying gameplay routine of battling then wandering the hub and choosing how to use your time effectively to maximize and build the characters you've recruited and teach. The majority of the main characters are very likable, with their own quirks and stories that make them memorable, funny, annoying, and tragic. The soundtrack is one of my favorites I've ever heard in a video game. While you do have some time between main story points and it can feel grindy, you can fill that time by focusing on and doing side story quests for other characters that grant useful items or unique story points for them later on. A lot of the DLC and free content update save data to the game have been things at fans have asked for or recommended and the developers have been kind enough to patch things in that people wanted, to small things like wanting to pet dogs and cats and feed them. The different story routes hit different notes, meaning that you are bound to find one that you enjoy, though I've liked all of them. Almost the entire game is voice acted, except for some minor text boxes in the hub area. The va's all did really well, even lines that seemed cheesy in writing to me would get a pass things to their delivery.

I absolutely adore this game, and if you are wanting to dip your toes into Fire Emblem I think it is a great start."

  ",8,"This is the perfect introduction to the Fire Emblem series. In fact, I loaned the game to my friend, and both him and his girlfriend completed it. So if you are on the fence about the series, then definitely you should give the game a try. It has an extremely addictive gameplay loop that makes you feel constant progression. ****, in fact if you like games like Animal Crossing or the old Sims, this is probably right down your ally. I will say as a Fire Emblem fan, I enjoyed the game more on my first playthrough than subsequent ones where I began seeing its shortcomings. I wish there was a higher difficulty setting and a more refined end game. I see Fire Emblem Three Houses as an extremely safe game that could have been even greater if more development time was spent. Alas, what we do get is still incredibly worthwhile! I'm hopeful for the future of Fire Emblem."

  ",9,"Three Houses is a superb Fire Emblem entry that brings mainstream appeal to the otherwise niche series. Fire Emblem Awakening is the other entry that had similar appeal, but Three Houses truly brings Fire Emblem to a new frontier: Aping Persona. The reason why Persona is so appealing while other JRPGs are passed over is perhaps one of the great mysteries of the modern age. If imitation is flattery, Persona must be feeling pretty good right now.

Jokes aside, Three Houses leans heavily on its plot and characters. A dark, inherently flawed continent replaces the traditional evil country vs. super good nation with blue haired prince Fire Emblem dynamic, and it's very well received. The characters bear the flaws of their surroundings with them, underneath posh character designs that belie the brutality of their medieval setting. It's as if Fire Emblem has realized what it always should have been.

The leads, in particular, are phenomenally written. Edelgard is worlds of depth away from any Fire Emblem character before her, perhaps because she's partly based on one of Fire Emblem's earlier best characters. Dimitri is perhaps a more standard tragic protagonist on paper, but the design team, the writers, and Dimitri's superb voice actor make his characterization among the best in gaming. The rest of the students are no slouches either, each having plenty of depth for the player to encounter through their supports and other interactions around the monastery. Fire Emblem's trademark depth of cast is on full display here, perhaps more than ever before.

Gameplay itself is ok. Intelligent Systems seems to have more or less abandoned balance in favor of entertainment. That's fine, just don't go in expecting a fair, ungameable challenge. If you make your whole army (or even most of it) wyvern knights, you can trivialize most of the game. Still, it's not like you have to do that, so plenty of fun to be had regardless. Monsters are a new and perfectly designed addition to Fire Emblem, complimenting gambits quite well. Proper preparation with multiple units is required to succeed in the more complicated monster maps. Game Freak should take notice, since this is similar to the Dynamax pokemon method of difficulty spiking. Intelligent Systems has done it right here.

You do have to play through 4 routes to see all that Three Houses has to offer. While they can get repetitive at times, I still found myself wishing there was a fifth after completing all 4. Three Houses is the sort of experience that fans of Persona and SRPGs would do well to have."

  ",10,"An absolute joy to play. The addicting and engaging gameplay dynamic with battles, exploration of the monastery and teaching never got old despite the four playthroughs I went through. The music was beautiful with a wide range of tracks and the graphics though not groundbreaking, were great. Characters, for the most part, felt well developed and interesting especially post time skip and I never had an issue with anyone's voice acting. There's very little to criticise in my opinion however this was my first fire emblem and really first strategy game so I could see long term fans having some gripes with the game. For example, the masterclasses even to me felt a little undeveloped and there could be some more maps to battle on. I could also see some people getting tired of the exploration and teaching systems, although personally I never did. My only real complaint would be the S tier supports or marriages as it felt like a missed opportunity to further develop your relationship with your desired partner. Also, I noticed there weren't many same-sex options for male byleth, didn't affect me but I know that will disappoint some people. Overall though, fantastic game and I highly recommend it."

For Japanese SRPG fans, this is a must-play. I gave 9 instead of 10 because (1) the Black Eagles routes are a bit too short and jumpy and (2) the combat could have been more challenging - I felt the lunatic mode was not challenging, but just unfair."

Some Things to remember are that 1.) You must do all supports to get the full experience, 2.) The game starts of a bit slow, but certainly speeds up, 2.) There is a secret 4th route.

  ",9,"I have always been a fan of Fire Emblem (FE) games, and this one didn't disappoint. It's addicting, entertaining, and can feel emotional after diving into the story deeper.

Its quality of life is something gamers should be thankful for, despite sinking in 120+ hours into the game, it doesn't bore you with too many unnecessary cutscenes and fluffs like other RPGs have. The fast forward function during cutscenes helps players become more engaged and not get burnt-out.

The gameplay is like any other FE games, it's solid. Depending on the difficulty you are playing at, you'll get different challenges from finishing the game too easily, to making you kill your controller due to the AI's painful maddening difficulty. Though that being said, the game doesn't suffer if you play on easier modes, I do believe that you'll still get the FE experience you're looking for.

The story is excellent. There are three possible endings (possibly four, depending on the choices you make) and the writers did a good job of not making it feel repetitive if you try to play all houses since they did a good job giving the player specific scenarios exclusive to each house that helps unfold more backstories for the characters.

I've spent  120+ hours of gameplay (and counting) and have completed two endings. That only means there's another 100+ hours waiting for me if I continue to play and unlock the other endings for the other houses.

Overall, if you're a tactical JRPG fan, then you should definitely buy this game and add them to your collection. The content is packed, and the game assures you that your $60 was well spent."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem is a franchise I had only ever shown a passing interest in prior to Three Houses. I played the 3DS games to the end of their respective stories and left it at that. After playing Three Houses, I can say with full confidence that my interest in this franchise is no longer passing.

Three Houses stands about its 3DS counterparts for the fantastic narrative it creates, tied together by interesting characters, an immersive world, engaging gameplay and outstanding sound direction. Having spent 125 hours playing through 2 of the 4 potential endings, I can say my time with Three Houses has been one of my most memorable gaming experiences in my adult life.

The most obvious point of comparison here is with the Persona franchise, as both games try to supplement their main stories with added side content based around the game's characters on a more personal level. The Persona system of Social Links and Confidants has the advantage of being a much more refined system than is found in Three Houses, thanks to the fact that Atlus introduced these features early in the series' lifespan. Yet Three Houses still manages to create an engaging social aspect to the world it creates. Seeing my favourite characters meet, react to each other and develop as people felt just as rewarding as it does in Persona.

However, the main failing of Three Houses is also best portrayed with a comparison to the Persona series. Persona 3, 4 and especially 5 have received recognition for their striking visual styles. Persona 5 in particular pushed the boundaries in terms of game design and art style, seamlessly blending game interface and game art. Three Houses does not accomplish anything near this level. To be frank, Three Houses can be ugly at times. The character design is outstanding, but this is often devalued by poor environmental design outside of battle. Cutscenes with 3D models are often, if not always, accompanied by ugly 2D backdrops. This is Fire Emblem Three Houses' biggest weakness.

Yet, I am glad to say visuals are perhaps Three Houses' only real weakness. Combat is particularly engaging, arguably more so than Persona's turn based system. As Three Houses is a strategy RPG, there is a great deal of thought that must go into every move on the battlefield. It requires a sharp mind, or else a character may be lost (Unless you're soft resetting or playing on casual ofc). I found most battles to not only be a test of my strategic thought, but also as perhaps the most entertaining part of the game.

To keep the review somewhat short, I'd say Fire Emblem is one of the best games not only on the Switch, but one of the best games this year. Gameplay, story and side activities make the game engaging, interesting and almost infinitely repayable. What is perhaps a somewhat vain criticism, the game does not look good in the slightest, this is something I would very much like to see improved in the next entry. Aside from this, Fire Emblem is outstanding on the Switch, in the RPG genre, and gaming as a whole. This decade has been a roller-coaster for the Fire Emblem series, from almost total irrelevance in 2010 to what is perhaps the series high in 2019. I cannot recommend this game enough."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem Three Houses is an immersive game that adds a fresh perspective to the series and is a must have for any Nintendo Switch user.

While the sheer amount of things to do is quite overwhelming the game does notice that by only giving you a set number of options to use very week- and the key of this game is in the planning.

The world is complex, the characters unique and intriguing and the plot is extremely entertaining.
Make no mistake that whatever house you choose in the very beginning of the game will only get you through 60 to 70 hours of that houses story. You will have learned a lot, but there are two more houses you would have to pick again (if you want to get the full story ).

This game keeps up the pace with every single week being more and more insightful into the lives of the students and the teachers.
In part social in part tactical the game combines the best of both worlds with you the player being able to teach and interact with you students, motivate them, make decisions together that truly impact the game. At the same time also giving you a fair share of combat where you are forced to rely on your tactical skills to reach the end (and here I admissive most fervently to play in Classic mode)

The main character does not speak, and his story might not be the most compelling of them all, but the game never once lets you get bored. You have a dozen or more fully realised characters that require just as much attention and have incredible stories of their own- And this is probably the greatest part about the game.

I fully recommend this incredible game for this storytelling skills, strong characters and tactical combat."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem Three Houses is one of the best games that I have ever played. I have been a fan of the series for a while now, and this one blows the other Fire Emblem games out of the water. This games offers a huge amount of compelling story that will take you at least 70 hours to play through. I have been playing for 85 hours now and am around 50% done with the game (I like to take my time with games, so it takes me a lot more time to finish them). Another thing that I noticed about playing through this game is how much I wanted to come back to it. It never fatigued me or left me feeling like I had just wasted 3 hours of my day. The game keeps you coming back with masterfully designed characters, a fun and exiting battle mechanic, and a compelling story that will leave you wanting more.
This game changes up many things when compared to the previous generation of Fire Emblem games (The entries on the 3DS), one of the biggest new additions being voice acting. Every single character speech text in the entire game is brought to life with high quality voice acting. Beyond that, character models have been greatly improved from the previous game. Where they were once pixel bit characters on the maps, they are now high-quality characters that you can zoom in on, and see them in greater detail than ever before. This helps make the maps in the game feel like actual battlefields, and gives the game an extra feeling of immersion. When you are not in battle, you can spend your time running around the monastery, visiting and interacting with the characters, shopping for weapons, cooking food, or even fishing. This is a genius Idea, and It is being utilized perfectly in this game.
I was going to wait until I finished the whole game before reviewing it, but I decided that 70 hours was more than enough time to spend with this game to know that Fire Emblem Three Houses is an absolute masterpiece ****, and Is a shining example of what future Fire Emblem games, and tactical RPGs in general, should strive to be like. I hope this game wins at least one award at The Game Awards in a couple of weeks because it deserves so much attention and praise.

Fire Emblem has always been a series about fun strategic combat with a varied cast of personalities at your command. If it had some weak points, it would be that the main plot would often feel contrived and  bland, but this game doubles down on its strengths while lessening the impact of its weaknesses. Combat is now more varied than ever, with a stronger emphasis on customizable progression. As a professor, you have the ability to greatly influence the rate your characters learn skills and improve in specific areas. You can also choose battalions for your characters, a new addition to this entry, that adds more skills to use in combat. No other srpg just flows better and feels as fun to play. It's very enjoyable and engaging throughout the full 40+ hour campaign. Or I should say campaigns, since this game is highly re-playable with its branching stories. Also, the colorful cast of characters have somehow become even more colorful than before. Characters are now fully voiced and interact a lot with each others through conversations. It is a lot of fun to learn the history and personalities of each and every character through these, and some are quite surprisingly interesting the more you find out about them.

Unfortunately, its weaknesses are still present, even if they're less glaring than before. The overall plot will still feel convoluted or just silly sometimes, when the game is begging to be taken seriously. But again, because the other areas of this game are just so enjoyable it does not lessen my enjoyment of this game in the slightest. If you have liked any of the past entries of this series, you will enjoy this game greatly as it adds to their strengths. Highly recommended to any fans of the tactical rpg genre as well."

The two pillars of the series, plot and gameplay, are extremely well executed. The full voice acting also helps character building a lot and the voice actors were all great. I have 200+ hours in game and I regret nothing. One of the best entries for Nintendo Switch."

  ",3,"The first half of the game is almost good though easy as hell even on hard difficulty. But the second half... Let's split it into the sections
1. Balance
Before the time skip you don't even need to think to go through most of the missions. After the *spoiler* there is a huge difficulty spike. And no I'm not a dummy who can't do good trades or use game mechanics. Instead of creating difficult lay outs or introducing new game mechanics to make fights harder developers choose to make corridor maps with infinite enemy spawns. I literally had a situation where after 25 minutes of clearing mobs I had more enemies on the map than on the start of the mission. It's not a good game design it's an artificial difficulty
2. Story
Again the first half is fine. There is not a lot going on, but it's basically introduction to the world. The second half is the problem. I went eagle route. There is 18 chapters in it if I recall correctly. Imagine the game where right after a huge plot point progression stops for 6-8 hours in the last third of the game. That is FE:TH. 4-5 chapters at the start of second half provide no story whatsoever. And don't even try to argue ""you just didn't complete those side activities"". Main story should NEVER be hidden under various side activities. There are a lot of gamers who play story base games for the main story.
3. Characters
This one is controversial but I just didn't like them. They felt generic and almost all of them lack in character development. But I get why some people like them
4. UI
Some texts are unreadable in portable mod. And overall UI is far from perfect.
5. Performance
There a some awful looking textures, awful backgrounds and frame drops but it's not that big of a deal. The game is playable and looks fine
Can't rate it higher. I wanted this game to be good so hard but it's not even average imo"

  ",10,"I am 8 hours (about 3 chapters ) in and the game is fantastic from presentation,music, characters, content, gameplay and even story or lore for as much as I was able to get from them so far. Gameplay wise I am so happy to see that the mechanics are simple as long as you understand what combat arts and battalions are - no buffs and debuffs, no stupid weapon drawbacks like in Fates, overall no weird gimmicks. I love the different activities that you can do in order to make your characters better. For those who do not like the social aspect do not worry it is not mandatory but you will have a better experience and better units if you do them. I have to say that in 8 hours I had like 5 battles in total but I did not feel bored of doing the social activities because the social activities helped me earn money, items and of course improve my characters weapon proficiencies in order to be able to have better units in battle. I chose the Black Eagles but I love all the characters because each and any one of them is unique. I look forward to see what is going to happen later in the story and there has to be something awful happening later in order to change my opinion and give it a lower rating. Overall if you are into strategic rpgs and probably let's say you played games like persona you should definitely pick this game up.
EDIT: I have managed to finish 2 out of the 4 routes and I did this in 270 hours I can say that the story and characters are amazing. A drawback is that you have to choose the house of these characters in order to find out more about them and also the story is split and in order to find out absolutely everything about it you have to play absolutely all of them. Luckily Claude's route gave me enough answers in order to appreciate the story a lot. I started with Edelgard's route and unfortunately that was not the best idea because there is not many answers to the important questions that are being addressed. I recommend starting with Claude's route for the first playthrough because it will hook you in order to find out even more on the other routes. Overall I will keep the score that I gave this game initially because it exceeded all my expectations. Happy gaming :)."

Finally, as something more personal, I would recommend playing it in classic difficulty since I feel that it is enjoyed more in that way since the fact of losing a unit forever during that game makes you have to think better about your strategies as in chess Where every movement counts a highly recommended game if you have a Nintendo switch"

  ",10,"If you love playing JRPG then you have no reason to not play this game, the rosters starts at a bunch of generic characters who fit the standard archetype, but as soon you start  digging up the surface you will find very good scripted characters; the narrative fills its purpose very well, and while its not fully unpredictable it doesn't make it feel weaker.
The tutoring system and sunday exploration may cause a bit of frustration to players that doesn't like that kind of simulation but you can skip it and the game will do it for you letting to go straight to the history; I don't advice to do this however as that will make feel characters a bit shallow but if you want to focus in battles then you can do it.
The most important of a JRPG its is battle system and AI challenge and this game does have that for medium players, if you are a hardcore JRPG the standard difficulty will seems a bit low at start but that will compensate as you move forward into the history, the system allows to play as you want and that freedom can be a bit overwhelming if you don't want to dig in that but you don't have to if you don't want, also if you are hardsteel hardcore fan of RPG you can take the maddening difficulty and you will feel happy there, specially if you are no using a new game+ save to start from scratch and even if you use it the game will still challenge you.
It sound is lovely, relaxing when you are wandering around the monastery, exciting in the battles and even glee if the situation requires it; if you value the sound **** highly this game won't disappoint you at all.
And finally the only con of this game,  its graphics are a bit low matched to other games, that only when talking about the wallpapers which to be true are a low quality; but if you are playing to play and RPG the graphics won't bother at allow, the characters designs are beautiful, the game moves fluidly and there is no reason you should bother on the wallpapers as they don't meddles with the gameplay."

  ",4,"If you are someone who came on board with the franchise during the 3DS era and stayed there, than this game may very well come off as a masterpiece. There are improvements to the overall quality of the story and characters as well as a return of some classic gameplay elements that make maps a bit more interesting than other recent titles. However, if you look at this game in a comparison to previous console Fire Emblems, the games which the developers claimed to take great inspiration from, you'll be met with disappointment.

While Three Houses is an improvement of elements from the 3DS era, it's only that. It hasn't taken a necessary departure from elements in those games which actively compromise narrative quality and coherency. Byleth is perhaps the series worst iteration of a completely unnecessary addition: the avatar. The need for a player insert to be the center focus of the plot and several character's arcs compromises much of the story's integrity (and likely greatly contributed to the framing of one route in particular). The avatar being able to support with everyone for the sake of romance was already a drain on overall support writing quality, but now character's simply talk to silent brick wall as they rattle off the interesting bits of their backstories or suddenly surpass their issues. These explorations are rarely saved for supports between actual characters where their individual quirks or past histories would make for interesting conversation.
But even outside of Byleth, supports continue to be disappointing. While characters have moved on from having one quirk to solely portray their character, you can now generally expect two or three quirks. With one in particular being singled out for any group dialogue that happens between house members. Some conversations do manage to at least be humorous or entertaining, but rarely do anything to meaningfully expand on the depth of a particular character, explore their backstory, add to the world of Fodlan, or be tonally appropriate to the game's second act. And when a support chain does end up adding something meaningful, expect it to be rather redundantly explored again in a chain with a different character. Most A supports disappointingly follow one of two formulas: if the character's are m/f then expect some kind of forced suggestion of romance, if the character's are the same sex, then expect the conversation to go something like this ""Hey remember that trivial conversation we had 5 years ago? Well..."" and then another really trivial conversation. Supports tend to be better when at least one unit who is not recruitable into other routes is present, which leads to my next point of contention.

Like in Fates, the split route idea was poorly executed and hampers the game on multiple fronts. While a less obvious money making scheme, I see little reason to have had another multiple routes game other than how easy it is to build a marketing campaign over team rivalry (and boy are people rather zealously passionate about whatever house they picked first.. so it worked). Part 1 is far too long to have to replay for each of the game's routes and replaying it only makes the narrative road bumps in it more obvious, the maps are not interesting enough to justify how many times you'll be revisiting them unless you're very invested in doing weird builds for units, part 2 of any route often shares the same story beats with one another if not the same maps outright, being able to recruit many of the characters regardless of which route you're on ruins a lot of character integrity, etc. etc. etc.
The split routes only work on a thematic level of distinctly separating your main lords ideology, but the game itself doesn't really care about maintaining enough internal consistency or actually saying anything for this to be a good enough justification.

Now for some sightly more petty complaints:

Dialogue. Now this may very well be the fault of some rushed translating. The game has a lot of text and literal translations seem to be a broad issue lately with bringing over Japanese media. But man, sometimes characters say a whole lot without ever really saying anything at all. And voice acting seems to bring little clarity to this.
Graphics. Pretty awful. 3D models technically add more to support conversations, but not enough from what you'd expect them to add. It gets tiring to see character's cycle through something like only eight different emotes. Battle animations have some nice flare but something about the choreography of attacks adds little weight to the motions themselves. And the cutscenes.... Choppy with poor direction, weirdly trying to look 2D with 3D models. Radiant Dawn and some of the 3DS cutscenes have more visual appeal than what's on display here.
Music. It's fine if not for over-relying on one or two leitmotifs. I felt like Fates has this issue, too. However, I was really hoping for the same kind of quality as Echoes' OST."

  ",6,"As a Fire Emblem fan, this game is a little disappointing. The positive points on it are the battle system and how beautifully the graphics are made. The story has good plots too. I believe one of the main failures of it is that the characters are very unidimensional, with poorly constructed personalities which I found hard to relate. They do not shine as in previous games. Not to mention how the game seems to take a step backwards as it limits several relationships, not including LGBT options in a proper way. Another negative point is that the master classes are a bit conflicting, favouring some weapons much more than others and commonly adding a horse or dragon to more or about 70% of them. The ""school"" exploration is a bless and a curse, fun in the beginning until it becomes so overly grindy and tedious. You can skip it, but when you skip one of the game's main attraction, there's certainly something wrong with it.

Fire Emblem can be and deserves to be much better than this. With more personality, good interactions and a little more attention to the evolution of classes, this game could have been nearly perfect. Unfortunately it is not there yet."

  ",10,"Just broke past 250 hours and as a series veteran I got the itch to make an account just to review Intelligent system's magnum opus. This game takes the positives (timewheel, things to do between missions, multiple routes, magic) of the modern games, mixes it with the great story and character development of most older entries in the franchise, somehow pumps up all these things to 11 and still manages to include risky but rewarding changes completely unique to this entry all the while not feeling overloaded or cluttered. Magic and archery are even more rewarding, valuable and unique than ever with magic now having limited uses per mission instead of being tied to items or costing hp and archery finally feeling like a balanced and not absurdly over or underpowered mechanic. Character progression and choice in character progression is also better than ever with the ability to train specific skills outside of combat and promotion trees being far more open and accessible than previous series entries. The story is also a triumph of character writing with each faction truly believing they are right yet having their own faults. No faction has all the answers and it is up to you the player to decide which ending is the best for the characters. Speaking of characters the main and supporting cast of Three Houses is by far the strongest and most consistent of any series entry. Every last support line leads to some kind of character development on one or both ends and even entirely new information on characters is found which often is only found in that one support which truly incentivizes the player to recruit as many units as possible and level up every single support which is once again made far more convenient with activities that can be done between missions. This is the fire emblem game fans have been waiting the entire lifespan of the series to play and if it is an indication of the future of fire emblem I am extremely excited. Easily a must buy for the switch and likely the best entry point yet for newcomers to the series. If I could give this game a 100/10 I would. It does literally everything the series is meant to be about perfectly and then some and the only reason people should think twice before buying it immediately is if they don't have over a hundred hours to sink into it.

  ",9,"This was my first ever Fire Emblem game, so I was quite excited to see what it had got to offer. I have to say, I was positively surprised. I enjoyed this game a lot more, than I originally expected.

First of all, this game offers A LOT of content. Since you have the option to choose from three different routes, with each of them taking about 60 hours to complete, if you try to do as many side quests as possible. I have finished my first playthrough just a few days ago, but I can see myself starting another one in the future. The story is interesting and well written, which probably is due the well thought out characters. Every character has its own personality and a quite engaging backstory, which leads you to actually caring for them. In the late game it makes you really feel bad to kill or lose some of these characters. Furthermore, every character is fully voice acted, which just gives them even more individuality. You also notice significant character development, as you progress in the game. Definitely one of the greatest strengths of the game, if not the greatest.

What I also really liked were the side quests. Especially the fact, that some of them are based on events, which just happened in the main story. Even these side quests reveal information about the history or certain characters.

The game basically consists of three parts. There is the part, where you explore the monastery and talk to students / other professors, do activities, like fishing and helping people with certain tasks. By doing that, you enhance the relationship to your students / other professors, which unlocks support conversations. Additionally, having a good relationship to your students also increases their stats in battle, if they are close to each other.

The second part would be teaching your students skills, so they can master specific classes. As the teacher, you can set their goals, as well as boost skills individually. To gain most of these lessons, you need to make sure, that your students are motivated to improve their skills even more, by doing activities with them.

At last, we have the fighting. As far as I know, the mechanics didn’t change much, compared to previous games. The game does a great job at teaching you the mechanics. You have to think about which of your students should be on the front and which students you want to keep at a safer spot. After choosing the position of one of your students, you have the option to attack (if the enemy is in your reach), use an item or wait. It can be quite satisfying to beat multiple enemies in one turn without losing an ally. But one thing I don’t like is the durability system of the weapons. By attacking enemies your weapons are wearing out and if the durability of a weapon hits 0, its power and accuracy decreases. You can talk to the blacksmith to repair your weapons, but he will ask you for materials to do so. The problem is, in the preparation phase of a battle, there is no option to buy these materials. You can only buy them from the merchants in the monastery, which you don’t have access to in the preparation phase. I think it would have been better, if you could repair your weapons by just paying the blacksmith with gold. That way you wouldn’t have to make always sure to buy enough materials before a battle. However, another positive thing is the opportunity to rewind time to reconsider your actions if you lose a student for example. Even though you can use that ability more than ten times in the later game, which is almost a bit too much in my opinion, it is a welcome feature.

Unfortunately, the graphics really aren’t the best. That also goes for some of the animations. While the character models are pretty good, the environment just isn’t beautiful to look at. Also collisions are basically non-existent. You can walk through cats and pillars, like they weren’t even there. Personally I don’t need fancy graphics, but it definitely would have been better if the developers polished them a bit more. On the other hand the soundtrack is pretty good.

All in all, I really enjoyed Fire Emblem: Three Houses. It has surpassed my expectations by far and I have had a great time with it. You really should check it out, if you are interested in a SRPG with an engaging story and well-written characters."

  ",7,"This was my first Fire Emblem game and I must say, it was a good game... but. But.

I've only beaten the Golden Deer route so far and I liked the story overall. A little too many plot twists for my liking and I also felt like too much was left unexplained. I don't know if I just missed less obvious details but at the end of the game, I was still left asking the same questions I expected to have been explained by this point. Still, the plot was alright and I certainly got attached to most of the characters, I learned to care about them as though they really were my students. I loved the music, I loved the general idea of the game, and I loved Claude and Sylvain. But.

I have three major problems with this game. Firstly, I need to talk about performance. I cannot say the game had the most impressive visuals I've ever seen and honestly, I don't think anyone could say that. Despite that, the performance was by no means ideals. The game kept stuttering when exploring the monastery, moving from one area to another one wasn't as smooth as I wish it had been – I got interrupted by loading screens when I least expected it, and I must say the loading screens were annoyingly long overall for a game like this.

Secondly, I found the game too repetitive. The first 20-30 hours were fun, given I'd never played a FE game before, but later on, and especially after the time skip, the battles got so repetitive I literally avoided battling as much as I could. Towards the end of the game, I only took up the obligatory battles and nothing else. I wish there were more quests and that they were more interesting and varied. I liked the extra story quests since they had tiny story bits sprinkled around them, both during the actual battles and the cutscenes preceding and following them, but there just wasn't enough of those. I also got really annoyed at the time rewind ability, or rather not being able to use it during the enemy turn. I literally groaned out loud every time something bad happened to my units but I knew I would have to wait until all the enemy units end their moves just to rewind... and see them do the very same stuff all over again.

Thirdly, as I refused to play as a straight character, I hated everything about the romance system and how it tried to **** me up in all the ways possible. I played as the male protagonist and guys kept on reminding me whenever they could that ""they don't swing that way"", and girls kept on trying to hit me up, which was even more annoying since I felt that in many cases, it was out of their character and forced just to satisfy the potential straight male gamer. The sequel-like stories didn't help either, especially given that I chose to stay single, faced by the lack of any better option. The only **** romance options in the game I found at best limited and lazy and at worst disrespectful and condescending.

All in all, I have mixed feelings about this game. It was a fun experience overall but some things just kept bugging me, spoiling all the fun. Also, I would like to apologize if any of my word choices in this review came off as weird or confusing. I played the game in Japanese and just finished it a few minutes ago so I might have still been under the influence of the Japanese language version of the game when writing."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a fantastic game, worth your time! There are 4 different routes, so it has great replay ability. There are many characters to play with, each which has their own flushed out personality. The game gives you MANY things to do during each week. Each route gives you a different perspective of the story, and helps fill in the gaps from other routes. You must play all 4 routes to know everything! The DLC is also fantastic. They added some new costumes, and a new game + mode, which makes playing the other routes faster, and more enjoyable. There is also more story DLC coming out in 2020! I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan."

  ",9,"This is probably one of my favorite games this year. I will say I only did the Blue Lions run, so my opinions will be based on that. I love how characters are handled, the group of the Blue Lions all work off of each other and serve a purpose within the scope of the story, the events all feel centered around them in the first half(since I am aware that each house has the same events in part 1) and the second half works as a great redemption story. Dimitri as a character is extremely well done and his character progression is among the best the series has ever had. The game is a bit easy at times, but it still gave me enough of a challenge to where I feel I got enough out of it. The soundtrack is amazing, and I love the designs. My biggest issues however, have to be the graphics, it's definitely not the best looking game on the switch by a long shot, KT helped out with the engine here, but also did FE Warriors which arguably looks a lot better despite coming out years before it.  Along with that, I have to say some aspects bugged me, like I wish could see how far I have to be for my combat arts like Deadeye to be usable, I wish there was a better way to repair relic weapons, and I wish I was able to deploy more units since I ended up not using a lot of the characters I stole from other houses. All in all, I enjoyed this game, and it's already one of my most played games on the switch despite being out for such a short amount of time."

I was willing to try out this game because of all the hype surrounding it which was well deserved. The gameplay was fun, really fun. I loved how weapons could break in the game to prevent it from getting boring because to be frank a lot of weapons practically insta kill which anyone would've abused. Switching from top down checkerboard to a close up 3D view was incredible as both of them played amazingly.

Story isn't something I care too much for and I don't often expect much of one out of a Nintendo game but the one in FE is no non-sense. For the base characters everyone speaks like human beings that can't be said of most anime artistic games. And the protagonist, Byleth, is absolutely ruthless and doesn't bring up the cliche pacifist trope."

  ",9,"The most ambitious title from Intelligent Systems (made in collaboration with Koei Tecmo) so far, and man is it a success. These guys just never disappoint me. How far has this great franchise, which invented the genre that birthed many other great franchises, come since its NES debut and since its debut in the West with FE7 on GBA.
The numerous gameplay features take a bit of time to introduce which makes for a bit of a slow start ( the first one or two hours ? can't quite remember ), but once it's on it's one of those games that just keeps on giving. After a while, walking the ""hub"" ( aka Garreg Mach ) to talk with everyone and look for spawning items can become a bit of a hassle though (one that can be avoided, but I'm the thorough type of player), thankfully not enough to spoil the fun for me.
High replayability value too as you have the choice between three houses each with different characters in them, as well as different branches in the story for each of them, and a NG+ mode which introduces new features. I myself finished it in 75 hours and will most likely go for NG+ if only to get to know a bunch of other characters in a different house and see where the story gets them.
A must-have for Switch owners, highly recommended!

EDIT: I saw it mentionned by other people so I will react to it, but I do feel the comparison to Harry Potter is very obvious to make. Sure, there is magic, and sure the school looks like a castle, but way more than that is that the tone of the story starts up very light while the students are enjoying what looks like an unusual but rather pleasant school life, and ends up becoming a way darker, sad and mature story. Not a bad comparison, I grew up reading the Harry Potter books, and whether you like this series or not, it's now a classic that made millions of kids dream. Hopefully this game will do the same for the kids that play it today."

  ",8,"It's an excellent mainstream game but it's really overrated. I can gladly give it an 8 but not more.

Just as many other mainstream JRPGs, the true focus of the game is actually the character interactions and romance, while the main story just serves as a back drop, unfortunately.

It's good that they attempted something relatively new among mainstream games, which is to try to present the main story from several sides, who conflict with each other. Unfortunately, eventually they somehow still deemed it necessary to play it safe and introduce some absolutely cartoonish ""villains"", so that they take all the blame, while every ""normal character"" can be whitewashed. Sorry, this is simply not how the real world works. This sort of black-and-white, good-vs-evil thinking is not just stupid, it's downright dangerous.

The battles/maps are generally not satisfying enough. Part 2 of the story is rushed, and many plot developments on the main story simply don't make much sense or are clearly unfinished.

They clearly devoted their main effort to writing and directing all the character interaction stories. But to view all of them you need to grind incessantly, which is a huge waste of time. According to the stats on my save, I spent more than 80 hours just to finish my first route...... which is ridiculous. I don't even spend that much time with some actual Visual Novels, which have really deep and well thought-out stories, save the pain of having to do lackluster battles in between.

If watching those character interaction soap opera and romancing the characters is the whole point of this ""game"", why not just go on YouTube and watch all of them easily?"

  ",10,"I really would give this game a 9.5; however, that's not an option. It is not a perfect game; however, it certainly comes close compared to many games out there.

Without spoilers, this game provides a lot of value in terms of hours of gameplay. There are 4 story routes -- 3 obvious ones (3 houses, duh) + 1 hidden path. All paths share a basically 90% similar first-half, and then they branch off. It makes sense when you get into the actual story and when you get engaged with the path you choose, you won't even notice how much time is passing. I chose supposedly the shortest route on my first playthrough and ended up sinking in 65 hours into the save file (though my Switch logged 80+ hours because the savefile obviously doesn't count time if you've reset). I made use of all the save file slots to explore possibilities. If I had one complaint in that department, it would be a wish for more save file slots -- I think there are only five.

The sound track is superb -- and like other games in the series, there is dynamic battle music. If you have battle animations (on by default), you'll notice a change in the music score as it zooms in to the characters to play the battle animation. The sound track is also memorable and fitting for the occasion -- right now I'm thinking of Wrath Strike that plays when you initiate combat with a boss. I wish the music was all included in the OST; however, they are not. One of the cool things though that I appreciated was the Amiibo Gazebo -- if you scan characters from older Fire Emblem games, it unlocks changeable soundtracks for battle skirmishes, among other things.

Where could they improve? Well for one thing, people are complaining about FPS of the cutscene sequences, and they're not wrong. The 3DS games had really smooth animations for cutscenes, and it left me feeling a little confused at how this next-gen could screw that up. I wonder what was the technical difficulty? Either way, the cutscenes were still a great treat -- the content will still give you the goosebumps. I hope they have some sort of future patch for smooth cutscenes, but I doubt it.

I also wish they did mage spells a bit more justice with some of the animations. I'm also going to cut this review short just like how they did my favorite route :("

  ",9,"An epic tactical RPG adventure! When I say epic, I’m saying epic to the point I don’t actually know how long and extensive this game is. I am 80 hours in playing one of the (three) titles story arcs with the Black Eagles and I don’t think I’m near the end yet. I am playing on Classic Hard.

In this you play the role of Byleth who unexpectedly gets enrolled as a new professor at Garreg Mach Monastery and customization goes as far as picking your gender and giving Byleth a first name. You are given some brief background to his current place in the world working as a Mercenary with his father Jeralt enforcing the lands and supporting local villages in trouble with bandits and other unsavoury types. Your first big choice and what initially captivated me with Three Houses is what made me choose the Black Eagles. Most RPGS offer stat screens, starting gear, a starting class and other pre-set builds that help you decide how you want to begin. In the tutorial, you are introduced to the three main leaders of each house. And you get a chance to get to know them a bit better. This is where I broke off the path of usual RPG tropes and instead of focusing on what each house could offer me in the long run – stats, equipment and specialties wise. I focussed instead on which leader I liked the most, their personalities, their background, their aims and dreams and their attitude. For the first time in years, it felt like I didn’t have to research each character online before making my decision. The writing is so exceptional, it felt like these characters were real and I knew them in real life. This doesn’t just count for the house leaders, every single character in this game has such in-depth character development and no doubt you will be fully invested in these characters. From Bernadetta, the archer who suffers with extreme social anxiety and is riddled with such a low self-esteem, to Caspar, the young cocky wipper-snapper who’s naivety sometimes gets the better of him, to Hubert, the brooding sinister ‘Snape- like’ character who’s nose is nestled so far up Lady Edelgards bottom to the point of uncomfortable obsession. To add to the character development, you have relationship building, social class politics, side-activities, character specific side quests, role/class and stat building (achieved by teaching and exams), each is as equally important as the other and what you get is an in-depth ‘social’ sim alongside the tactical action side. This all happens in the exploration side of the game where you are given free reign of the academy.

In terms of the action, initially I thought it was very basic. I haven’t played any previous FE titles but I am accustomed to SRPGs so I had a rough idea of what to expect. You will expect the same if you’ve ever played an SRPG. You take turns managing your whole team by moving, attacking, healing etc then it’s the enemy’s turn to do the same on their side. Each team member can do one action per turn so you have to use this one action wisely to give yourself the advantage. What I initially thought was quite a basic battle system, becomes a lot more in-depth as your students grow and develop new abilities. They grow accordingly with the difficulty as well. I found the game gradually got more and more difficult as your options expand. There is an extremely useful ability that involves time travel which definitely helps in the later stages but you are limited to a certain amount so they are to be spent wisely. Despite the time travelling ability, it is still very possible to lose. All in all, combat is exactly what is expected and it isn’t ground breaking, this however doesn’t lose Three Houses points. It is extremely satisfying when a plan comes together and is a solid battle system overall. If you love a challenge, I recommend playing on Hard mode, I’ve read numerous accounts that normal is far too easy and requires virtually no thinking. I am looking forward to trying out lunatic mode after finishing my first playthrough.

Not many downsides I can think of really, I guess sometimes there can be too much talking but I only found that frustrating after a long play session so that’s my problem really. Only other downside I have is that Three Houses has one of the most tedious, boring fishing mini-games I’ve ever played and I usually love fishing mini-games – rewards are pretty minimal as well even though it is a prominent way of bringing in money for your house.

A solid 9/10 game, packed with content."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem Three Houses is a true delight and a must-have for anyone who owns a Switch. Its gameplay is engaging and gives you plenty of reasons to come back for more. Strategical combat, the series' main premise, feels as fresh as it was in Radiant Dawn for the Wii. Battalions, Combat Arts and the new magic system, were welcome additions to the series that I had plenty of fun using.  The map design was splendid and made me think hard about how I approached the enemy. Every unit and weapon in the game feels completly balanced and unique. Even the legendary sword is balenced by a strict durability system. Combat is bridged out by the new calendar system, giving you plenty to do outside of heated battle. You can explore the monastery, hold seminars, battle or take a day of. Each option feels just as good as the last. The game's characters are probably some of the best characters in the series. Each had an individual story to tell and made me think twice about mindlessly killing them in battle. That said, the game isn't perfect and has plenty of problems, difficulty being one. Even on Hard mode, the game puts too much effort into holding your hand. Combat forecasts and agro displays will make sure you never miscalculate a move. The game even generously lets you turn back your mistakes with divine pulses. The game has enough modes for new players, but nothing satisfying for seasoned veterans. It can get to a point where you don't need to sacrifice any units, much less lose the game."

First,  a lot inconsistency are present in the story telling ( so much that i've lost the count before the 10th chapter)

Secondly, when you try to introduce a new game mechanic, be sure that it has a purpose. Cause  putting a rewind time just ""broke"" the game. If you want to play on perma death it's useless; and if you don't want to use the perma death it has no purpose whatsoever.

After that, the plot twist is ..... no comment.....  ( you can clearly see who's going to stab you in the back and you can clearly see some ressemblances with other Fire Emblem character and their plot twist ...)

Then, you are obliged to wait to get deeper in certain relationship ( obliged to wait for the history to move on) You can be in a S relationship before the second half of the game ...

After that , we could talk about bad framerate, bad graphism, the UI who S*cks balls, having more than 4 times the same map to battle on, waifus and husbandos spitting the same line of dialog over and over till you begin to hate your own waifu, and so on ....

Story: WHERE do i even start ? there are 3 houses to choose from black eagle , Leicester alliance and the blue one i haven't done yet but there is a less so obvious 4th option but i wont spoil that one. and each house has a a very similar almost the same part 1 but part 2 is where this game really shines, each story is so vastly different and all of the house leads are written really well and are strong characters . In fact there is very few weak characters. almost every character is lovable in their own way but the writers weren't afraid to write deeply flawed characters that are rooted in today's society dealing with themes of social anxiety , depression, parental pressure. religion and weather it dose good or is it an out dated relic of the past that has no use or want in modern day and its that last one to witch the main story revolves around. the endings are based on your choices and who you want to be friends simmilar to fallout nv witch has the 4 main endings and minor endings based on how you handled side quests.
Story: 10/10

World building:  the story was phenomenal even with all its endings they all just worked. but the world building was slightly less so, only slightly. and i cant quite put my finger on why i was under whelmed by the world building maybe because its such a slow burn with character focus world building takes a back seat in an already slow paced game it made me feel like the world hardly had any life during my first play-through. not to say its not worth it because it is. the characters are all directly tied to a lot of the lore witch makes the lore extra interesting to come across , like what characters were childhood friends , had chance encounters when they were younger with other characters and changed their lives. witch ones are power hungry gods and want to keep humanity enslaved under the guise of a religion, and even witch ones are related , is all stuff you learn based on your play through .  you even learn  about other country's in the world from other characters who are from there but its mostly stuck to one country witch is divided into 3 territory (hence the three houses)
World building: 8.5/10

Graphics: the graphics didn't blow me away its definitely a stylish game very anime in its ascetic but the graphics them self arnt technically good like other Nintendo titles like Mario or blending style and tech like in the legend of zelda. good news is the graphics do not take away from the game but the style dose add to it blending well with the shounen inspired main story, this game is basically your own shounen adventure and you decide witch ships end up together in the end And thats what this game looks like a shounen anime.
Graphics: 8/10

Gameplay: there is so much to this game , its basically 2 in one , the church part that's basically a dating simulator as well as a sensei simulator. the other is the battles witch range from small skirmishes and constantly get bigger and bolder without the escalation issue because you worked hard to make it to this spot and you seen the work you and the characters put in to get here so it all feels earned. same with the supports ( its basically who is friends how good of friends they are and who likes who ) its a social thing and this is where alot of the characters are showen as people first units second, i didnt play with perma death but i know its there and when ever a unit died i would think to my self ( well id be sol if i was doing a perma death run) i feel like you arnt even supposed to do a perma death run until you have started like your 5th new game plus. New game plus is really well done in this game , you can use your renown to buy alot , like supports you had in previous playthroughs and professor level makeing it easier to recruit who you want the second time around and to be able to build your squad and your character.
Gameplay: 10/10

Sound design: The voice acting was good , i think they all did the best with what they had. i loved how well written the characters are but a lot of them have terrible scripts and dialog is often times bland. with a few exceptions. the music how ever ins really good BUT i feel like its understated this game clearly has a good sound track but falls in the philosophy that it shouldn't be noticed witch made it hard to pick out certain tracks. but the songs that hit REALLY HIT. the techno of the underground city in the Leicester alliance ending battle comes to mind.
Sound design: 8/10

10+8.5+8+10+8=44.5= 8.9

Fire emblem the three houses is a must have for switch owners and i think in time will be considered a classic."

  ",4,"This game fixes some of the problems with the split story of Fire Emblem Fates, but still suffers from some of the same problems even though the story splits later on. You have a case in which three of the four paths just feel like they didn't bother to resolve all their problems while one of them does. Gameplay wise, it's a return to the older days and is more like classic Fire Emblem era games than Awakening. If you were a fan of Awakening and Birthright, this is not the game for you. If you liked Conquest and the pre-Awakening era games, then Three Houses is for you.

The game is divided into two major segments. The first is the school life where you hang around the monastery and talk to people, give them gifts, build relationships and such. This is modeled after the third person stuff they developed from Echoes and built on it. The other part is the traditional turn based systems. But like with Conquest and pre-Awakening games, you're pushed along the story with what is essentially an action limit so you are not free to take your time. The result is that even though it feels like there's a lot to do, your ability to actually do things are capped by an artificial time limit. As someone who is bigger fan of the Awakening era games, this is disappointing considering that they even said they would use Fates as the metric for determining the future of the series. The series is gradually falling back into the old ways and needs a course correction."

  ",5,"bueno, me ha parecido directamente atroz. Si esta es la dirección de la franquicia me bajo aquí. Nada que decir en cuanto a historia, que está bien, ni de los personajes, bien tratados. Tampoco de las infinitas interacciones entre ellos y Byleth. Aunque es precísamente a partir de ello que el juego me ha parecido horripilante. No esperaba encontrar un juego que es basicamente 70% social links (subir niveles de apoyo tomando el té, invitando a comer y demás) y 30% srpg. Y lo peor es que ese 30% aun en hard / classic no tiene ninguna chicha, es un paseo y simplón, tanto que puedes enviar a tus 2 unidades rotas palante y basicamente solearte toda la historia con ellos. Yo buscaba un srpg y a este FE le queda poquito de ello. Coñazo indescriptible que no suspendo porque no lo hago con nada que me termine. Pero lo he hecho con la gota de sudor. Terminada ruta Golden Deer con Lysithea de waifu."

Having to repair weapons or rank up has a massive cost that regular gameplay doesn't cover. I find Fates to have the stronger game play and story. Also you can't design your own character, I understand this is because they have now animated their cut scenes but it takes away from the game. Also not all the story plots are animated."

Zelda BOTW  is better than Three Houses? ""Technically"" yes. But the thing is: Fire Emblem Three Houses does not have a couple months released yet, and I already have MORE time played. And man. I played Zelda big time... I played a LOT of it! Fire Emblem Three Houses simply have the best replay value I ever tried so far. I am a huge fan of Three Houses now. Just don't know how to stop. Finished twice, and going for third time. Yesterday Nintendo just released a FREE DLC, and i'm planning to play for a forth and fifth time (to see the complete story). Don't listen to the bad reviews. You should not try that game. You should have it. This is one of those games that you know that you are playing a classic.

The battles are far too easy, even on hard mode, and the various monastery tasks soon become very boring and repetitive.

I still have 3 different routes to take! If each take 40 hours, that's about 160 hours of play! That's only the main story. There's so much else to do. This was my first Tactical RPG, (and my first Fire Emblem) and I'm blown away by the gameplay. I will be playing this even after I finish all of the storylines just for the gameplay. The anime-style cutscenes were great. I think the low framerate looks awesome during these. The only complaint I have (which bumps it down a score) is the graphics. Some of these graphics look like literal garbage. If you go to the marketplace, you can see the fruit textures with such low-quality renders. During support/mission conversations, the background is just a flat image, and it looks terrible, especially when the ends meet. It can sometimes be distracting from the game. I do like the character models, they look perfect to me. The voice acting is great, and I have no complaints. This is a must-play if you have a Nintendo Switch."

  ",10,"So why should you get Three Houses? To put it in it's simplest terms, this is the best gameplay and story you can experience this year in my opinion. By far the best game in the series. One of the best games ever made, and maybe even the best game ever made.

If you haven't played Fire Emblem or a game of this genre before they play like a version of chess. Every unit has certain attacks and certain movements that they can make, and different weapons will preform better against certain adversaries. For example, flying units a very weak to bows. This system creates a feeling I have not seen replicated in any other game, though not for lack of trying. This game makes you feel like an actual strategist and takes real thought and good planning and knowledge of how every unit will work if you want to be good. I will admit that this is probably the easiest game of the series though, but I think this just makes the game much more accessible. The gameplay here is as great as it always has been, but that's not the main reason I like it.

The story is where this game excels more than almost any other. The world that has been created feels somehow very far from reality but also very relatable, tackling issues that many will have experienced in often beautiful and heartwarming scenes. The game, early on, very clearly separates your students into two different groups, nobles and commoners. There is a very interesting conflict between these two groups, wherein both groups really hate the position they were put in by their birth. This isn't a topic I have seen explored much in gaming and I think the devs do an excellent job here.

Another aspect of the story that I feel is very unique is the perspective it has on war and conflict in general. A lot of games we play today glorify war (COD, Battlefield, etc.) And while I obviously don't think these games support war in any way or have any negative impacts on the world, I think the way it is portrayed in Three Houses is much more interesting and refreshing. You will have many moments where you have to do some things that you don't want to do. The fighting is not glorified, good people die for seemingly no reason, your students will complain about the amount of killing they have experienced and mourn those that are lost. There is not really, in my opinion, a villian. There are multiple sides that each have their own reason and that don't want to fight each other, but they have to. I don't want to spoil much but I haven't ever played a game where I had to train kids to be killers and watch them grow up to live up to that training and then watch them resent the position they are in, it's refreshing, and a lot of the time depressing, and I love it.

Another huge aspect of the game is the support system. Every character has a set of supports, which are basically bonds with other characters in the game, that will evolve throughout the game as the characters relationships change. This is where a lot of the smaller and more relatable topics are handled, such as depression, loneliness, the burdens that are thrust upon people at birth and more. These moments are where the more heartwarming moments that I mentioned earlier come in as you watch your friends overcome their issues and become better for it.

This is my first time making a post like this so it's probably all over the place but I finished the game just a few hours ago and I want to make sure that as many people as possible are able to play this game and support everyone who has made this masterpiece. Please do yourself a favor and check it out, I don't think you'll regret it.

The soundtrack is also beautiful and amazing. Especially the tracks during the last few battles. Nothing much more to be said here, I love it."

It's a rather linear game as your hand is held all the way through, with no exploration other than wondering the monastery which is useless halfway through the game as missions stop appearing and your left with nothing to do.
The game could really have benefitted from some more cinematic cutscenes as I can't even remember 3 total.

A Fire Emblem with all its letters.
We are what I think is the best Fire Emblem ever made, even above the savior of the Fire Emblem Awakening franchise.
Graphically conservative, although it gives us scenarios, characters and best of all voices. Each dialogue, each cinematic, is perfectly dubbed into English and / or Japanese depending on the language you choose, something that had not been seen in any other game in the saga, in addition to this clear evolution we have the already famous animations in Japanese Anime style that They are a waste of quality as little.
With nothing more and nothing less than 4 different stories to complete this title is outlined for one of the most extensive of the saga and that as of the date of this review we still have no news of the DLC coming in the near future.
Given that these DLCs have nothing to do with the main campaign and they are not cuts to it, I have nothing bad to say or mention about it.
Simply a game that you must have in your collection if you own a Nintendo Switch, highly recommended.

SPANISH:

¡UNA EVOLUCION CON ALMA DE RADIANT DAWN!
Un Fire Emblem con todas sus letras.
Estamos a lo que a mi parecer es el mejor Fire Emblem que se ha **** jamás, por encima incluso del salvador de la franquicia Fire Emblem Awakening.
Gráficamente conservador, aunque nos regala escenarios, personajes y lo mejor de todo voces. Cada dialogo, cada cinemática, está perfectamente doblada al inglés y/o japonés dependiendo del idioma que elijas, cosa que no se había visto en ningún otro juego de la saga, además de esta clara evolución tenemos las ya famosas animaciones en estilo Anime Japonés que son un derroche de calidad como poco.
Con nada más y nada menos que 4 historias diferentes que completar este título se perfila para uno de los más extensos de la saga y eso que a la fecha de esta reseña aún no tenemos noticias de los DLC que vienen en un futuro cercano.
Teniendo en cuenta que dichos DLC no tienen nada que ver con la campaña principal y tampoco son recortes de la misma no tengo nada malo que decir o mencionar al respecto.
Sencillamente un juego que debes de tener en tu colección si eres poseedor de un Nintendo Switch, altamente recomendable."

The soundtrack is great and the new mechanics to the tactics game feel nice. Pretty much everything in this game is voiced and let me tell you, the English cast did beautifully it makes me just want to hear them way more nonstop. (Note: I don't really play JP voices in majority of games)

But FETH has been a nonstop burn from the start that keeps me thinking about the game throughout the day like no other game I’ve experienced. The story is rich with details and side conversations (that could be otherwise missed) which provide even more depth and lore into the world of Fódlan. Every interaction the player chooses causes a change in the relationships with others and the numerous ways you gain support prep up a really engaging game. The combat is thoughtful and I’ve felt very strategic as I’ve learned to play. I remember when characters like Marth and Roy we’re added to previous Super Smash Bros. games and I didn’t know what they were from or why they were there.

NG+ is particularly enjoyable since it lets you push your boundaries even further, allowing you to make your best magic users physical fighters and visa versa, allowing for amusing combinations of character specific and learned abilities and skills.  I can’t stop playing this game and I already have over 200 hours in it.

My only negative is that multiple routes share a large portion of maps, but seeing as most games only have 1 main route, it’s not too big of a deal.  Each houses students drive a lot of the variety in gameplay if you don’t recruit too much as I did on purpose.

This game is just absolutely fantastic"

  ",9,"While sometimes the writing can seem simplistic at times, it's amazing how deep they can take a cookie cutter story and make it as ""realistic"" as an anime style game can be with still a lot of charm. You care about these characters, you relate to them, you hate them, you love them and when they die, it's important to you. Some people say that this game is a copy of persona 5, well damn, persona 5 is a damn good game, and honestly, that seems like quite the compliment.
The gameplay is as solid as always. The lack of the weapon triangle lent to a wider capacity of customization and design by the player. Sure, some activities are mundane, but you start to appreciate as time passes.
My only gripe, is that some storylines are better than others (as in the story that each house will tell) and well, that is sad, because not everyone wishes to replay the game from start to finish once more. All in all, a great game, one of my favorites and I look forward to the next entry."

Good: 1.Interesting plot with the story broken up into three perspectives/outcomes adding replay value. 2. Enjoyable cutscenes with beautiful animations
3.Full voice acting that is quite good
4.Combat mechanics are sound although a bit basic compared to other games
5. Most characters are decently written adding to the impact of your choices
6. Interesting class designs although progression needs work
7. Music was pretty good

Aaand now the bad

1. Tedious and boring busy work at the academy that feels shoved in and unnecessary. If you are a completionist this will be a problem as I had to fight myself to keep going (simplistic fishing, scavenging and fetch quests ugh...)
2. The relationship mechanic feels half baked and unfulfilling given how much focus is placed on this (end game character synopsis is satisfying however)
**** worst offense in my opinion is that the game is far too EASY even on the hardest settings. I coasted during battles which is never a good thing. Only one maybe two maps gave me pause which is unforgivable in a strategy game that's famous for difficulty
4. The tactical maps are overall boring,  uninspired and recycled a bit too much. I feel this was the biggest missed opportunity in the game.
5.Graphics are far too ugly with a lot of delayed pop ins etc for a top tier game such as this. I normally am forgiving but this pushed it.

That's it. Its an ok experience and introduction into the strategy genre but for more experienced fans it leaves you wanting more.  Try harder next time Nintendo.

Buy it on sale or get XCOM 2 and a dating sim on the side. You'll have more fun."

  ",10,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses is probably my favourite game of all time. Everything about it is perfection. Well, maybe not EVERYTHING but it's still a gosh darn masterpiece. The story is complex, with many twists and turns. The characters are well-written with a great deal of depth, aside from a certain few (Raphael, I'm looking at you). The game is very customisable-every character can be any class and you can recruit students from other houses to yours. Each playthrough is unique and minimum 50 hours; I'm playing through my third route and have over 170 hours already. Furthermore, each route is different and unique, and there is even a secret 4th route! This makes replayability value off the charts and, personally, I don't even plan on stopping after playing all four routes! I do have some complaints though. The backdrops used in certain support conversations isn't exactly HD, but that doesn't really phase me. Also, my biggest concern is that there isn't a great deal of maps, so some paralogues and auxiliary battles reuse maps. However, the maps are some of the biggest in the series so scenarios are still quite unique. In conclusion, this game is an absolute masterpiece, and has dethroned Super Castlevania 4 to become my favourite of all time!"

  ",10,"It has come to my attention that a vast amount of fake reviews have been left for Fire Emblem Three Houses over the past few days. I am writing this on 02 SEP 2019 to set the record straight.

I have been playing video games since the NES was a big deal, and I can say with a clean conscience that Fire Emblem Three Houses is one of my favorite games of all time. This game manages to stay true to the spirit of the Fire Emblem series, but has had the game mechanics completely overhauled in a positive way.  In addition, the game is written masterfully to make you feel genuine emotion towards the characters that you interact with. This game is the future of the tactical RPG genre.

I believe that this game is worth exploring, so I want to avoid spoilers as much as I can. I will say that one of the most attractive features of the game is the ability to truly choose your own adventure. The game changes drastically based on the choices you make, gives you a wide variety of directions in which you can take the story, and gives you the opportunity to make said choices often. The fate of your in-game character is intertwined with all of the others in the game, so your choices can literally determine their destiny in many cases. Who will live or die? Who will be your friend, and who will be your enemy? What situations are unforeseeable? Much of this is up to you.

The mechanics are upgraded from previous games. They are complicated enough to entertain those with a great attention to detail, but simple enough that anyone can have a great experience without getting bogged down by overly complicated gameplay. For example, what ""class"" a unit has is no longer defined by their level. The level system has been redesigned to be more of an indication of what a particular unit is capable of.

The artwork is exactly what you would expect of Nintendo's newest home console. The cutscenes were striking and dramatic, and the in-game character models were sharp. They went all out on the latest installment of the series, and we're thrilled that they did. I would say that this is the best game in the series to be released since Fire Emblem: Awakening on the 3DS.

In the game review from Polygon, it was said that ""It's (Fire Emblem) as if someone who pens romance novels and someone who writes stereo instructions decided to co-author a 9000-page war epic."" The fact is, they're right! We wouldn't want it any other way! It is a game that is both technical and emotional, and is of interest to a very wide variety of people. It has everything you could want! Fantasy, combat, tactics, romance, exploration, consequences to your decisions, and more!

This game is fantastic, and the haters can get lost. That is all."

There is an impressive amount of scope covered between three lords under the same view points each with their own perspective and reactions to countless events with each cast each having their very own highs. Your first play though should be a lot of fun as you learn how the game operates and learn the unfolding of the maps and what strategies work, and once you finish you get the option for New Game+ to help you through getting to custom build how you want the world even more so than before.
However the biggest flaw in the game is really that there is just way to much shared content in maps with a difficulty on par with Sacred Stones and with as tools as broken and plentiful as Awakening. I still had a great time with this game and put in countless hours but after your first playthrough it's a bit down hill compared to your first time through. Also not every route is equal."

  ",10,"After spending much time with the game, i can say that this is a great game to own for the switch. There is a big enough difference from the rest of the series to show that it is unique, but there is enough to show that it is a fire emblem game. The game-play is much easier to get into compared to past FE  titles and the music is also great. Although there are a decent amount of negative reviews, many of them are individuals who want a past fire emblem game or are unsatisfied with a part of Three Houses. The game itself is great with a ton of replayability. Comparing it to a past title and giving it a 0 because its not like it is being unfair to Three Houses. They made a great game that both newcomers and veterans can enjoy without there being a hard roadblock anywhere."

  ",10,"FE3H is an amazing addition to the switch. The storyline and characters are captivating, creating an environment that the player can easily submerge themselves into. The battle system is very engaging, but I admit some of the classes have me bored. I can't wait for new unique classes as there is only one hidden class you can unlock thus far.

Each house campaign is very unique, and invites the player to keep exploring new routes in order to view the entire story as a whole. I can say any story based DLC for this game will be amazing! The only negative is waiting till the DLC is released. As far as time goes I am about 80 hours in and soon to begin my third campaign.

I have not experienced frame rate drops like so many 0 raters have suggested. I have also not experienced loading lags when entering new areas of the monastery. I would suggest to ignore most 0-1 reviews, as they do not seem very helpful within their criticisms and may possibly be trolls at this point. If you are still on the fence, I would suggest watching some longer walkthrough videos. FE3H for me is by far the best game release for 2019, and I cannot wait for more content."

  ",10,"After 3 playthroughs already, this has become my favourite Fire Emblem game of all time. As a player that mainly wants a good story, Three Houses delivers on all fronts. The amount of worldbuilding this game has is unparalleled for a fire emblem game and the game does a genuinely good job of making you care for all of it. The characters that appear in game have actual depth and personality to them and are far more than just cutouts of common tropes. There is also a lot of really good improvements on the gameplay side of things too, the quality of life changes are just astounding and they toned down many of the broken mechanics from the 3DS games so that players can actually have a fair and balanced experience. Speaking of fair and balanced, the actual maps themselves tend to be rather neutral, no ridiculous puzzle mechanics that are more annoying than interesting like certain maps in Fates notoriously had. Overall, for new and old players alike, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is well worth playing."

After my friend kept recommending the game over and over again I gave in and bought it day one after work. I was surprised that I had to go to three different stores since a lot of shops sold out quickly and I was being a bit impatient having to call each store to see if the game was available only to find out they had a few and  sold it a few minutes after arriving to the store.  Let me tell you it’s the best decision I made to wait and go to the third store. The game was easy to understand and the story is very well written and executed. I had to have self control sometimes because I’d play for hours on end. It’s been a while since I’ve played a game for 5+ hours and I’m glad this is the game I did it with. Due to me having more responsibilities like having a full time job I haven’t made time to play video games because I just didn’t have the time or I felt like it wasn’t worth losing sleep over. The game does a good job letting the player know how to play the game and gives it options to have it on easy/normal to hard mode, and the classic or casual mode so it can accommodate new and veteran players."

  ",10,"Just here to help offset the inane review bombing going on, but might as well leave my thoughts on the game while I’m here. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is incredibly addictive. It’s easy to load up on your lunch break and plan out your lessons for the week, share a few meals, or run through a battle map or two. The four routes allow for a ton of replayability and I’ve sunk well over 170 hours into this game already. My only issue with it is that the included hard mode (the highest difficulty level included at launch, although two more have been announced as coming in a future free patch) is still very easy, especially in NG+. On the one hand this allows for more experimentation with class builds and team compositions (as things currently stand, there are no truly hopeless units and any character can be a part of a successful team) as well as trying out battlefield tactics that you may not otherwise have tried, but one of the biggest draws of Fire Emblem for me has always been the difficulty. Hopefully the upcoming patch will offset this complaint as it has promised it will.

The game is amazing. The visuals aren’t always the best in the Monastery and the series beloved support scenes, but zooming into the battlefield and seeing all of the little details you might never have otherwise is an amazing experience, and being able to control characters at that level makes the game feel like a completely different genre at times! There are similar small touches throughout the game that weren’t needed but just make it clear how much the game is meant for fun. For example, the ability to control the little character on the loading screen—it’s absolutely adorable! That being said, the amount of loading screens can be a bit excessive. Normally this game would earn an 8/10 for me, maybe a 9/10 if the higher difficulty levels had been released, buuuuuut this game is currently in the process of being review bombed and I am marking it as 10/10 to offset that. I highly recommend this game if you have a Switch and, if you don’t have a Switch but have been considering getting one, this game could very well be the system seller for you."

  ",7,"It’s a good game. However, I do think people give it a bit too much credit. The story is good, easily better than Awakening & Fates, but it suffers from some serious pacing issues in the second half of the game. It feels odd to have to wait so long for your next mission, and unlike Awakening & Fates, where this down time is when you buy & forge weapons, you can just do that on the battle prep screen. And speaking of battles, I have some problems with them. First, they’re way too easy. The warp spell in this game, while it pales in comparison to Gaiden & Thracia, is overpowered, allowing you to clear most maps in a single turn. And the maps, while not bad, are very repetitive. On my second play through, I didn’t encounter a single unique map until chapter 20, almost the end of the game. They even reused the final map from one of the other routes, and I thought that they would at least give the final chapter a unique map. My last big problem with the gameplay is the balance of classes. To put it bluntly, it ****. There is little reason to not train your whole army to be a wyvern lord, as they can fly, have the highest movement stat in the game, and are incredible combat units. And to end this review on a positive note, Three Houses is one of, if not the most replayable games in the series, with 4 different stories & the ability to make any unit any class you want. Overall, it’s a solid game with some big flaws that keep me from rating it higher."

Lovingly crafted 3d models and settings allow for a more immersive experience in game. Characters are well thought out and struggle with topics that make them personable and charming. The game flows well and the plot draws you in - it's an emotional rollercoaster!
People have complained about lack of diversity among the male/male romance options, but personally I feel that their proposed solution of an avatar who could romance everyone regardless of gender would cheapen the experience. The only problems I have with this game is that they removed the optimise equipment option and I miss the character customisation, although having the pre rendered cutscenes is a nice touch. Overall it looks like a bright future for Fire Emblem if they pursue this direction."

  ",8,"To preface this: this is my first Fire Emblem hame. I’d heard of the series before playing, but I’d never touched it till now, and I gotta say I’m impressed.

First of all, the gameplay surprised me with how engaged I became with it. Things that I thought would be boring when I saw the trailers turned out to be massive time sinks. There are 2 main gameplay segments: the battles and exploring the monastery.

The battle mechanics in Fire Emblem are unique, and cant really be found anywhere else-not to this extent atleast. I’ll spare you the details as you can just find videos of the battles, but as a first-timer playing on the hardest difficulty I found them decently challenging. If youre a fire emblem veteran, though, its definitely going to be easier..

In the monastery you can perform many activities to bond with your students or give yourself some bonuses. You can plant and harvest crops in the greenhouse, fish on the lake, have dinner with pairs of students, go to choir practice, or just have tea with students or faculty. Participating in these activities is essential to building support between your characters and increasing student motivation-both of which are optional but highly recommended for the full experience. Increasing support with your characters allows them to gain certain bonuses while newr each other in battle, but also unlocks support conversations. This brings us to the next part of the game: the characters. I’m happy to report that every single character in this game is complex, and just *feels* real. They all have doubts and fears, things that excite and motivate them, flaws and little ticks that get you invested in them. theyre all overflowing with so much character thats evident in every interaction you have with them, and this is just accentuated by the spectacular voicework the VAs have done. As you unlock more support conversations with characters you feel your bond deepen with them, and you genuinely want to protect them-adding an entire new layer to the story.

Speaking of the story, its just as good as the characters are. Its a war epic that starts tame, and relatively happy-go-lucky in the first part, before getting dark and gloomy in the second. It deals with themes of morality and oppression and handles them masterfully. In the second part you discover that no characters are strictly “good” people. Everyone operates in a grey area, just like in real life. The main antagonist has views many would agree with, but methods many would consider extreme and it all comes together in a way that makes fighting against them morally conflicting.

The music in the game is nothing to write home about, but is serviceable. Theres a really nice credit song and one out of the two battle songs is great, but nothing is that memorable.

Performance on the switch is stable for the most part, but in the larger battles near the end of the game it tends to dip pretty heavily. Ive also found a few rare frame drops even in the monastery, but overall nothing spoils the rest of the game.

Overall, I highly recommend this game for any jrpg fan, and even strategy game fans who dont particularly like jrpgs will enjoy the combat. The story is nothing like classic jrpgs (which tend to be filled with tropes and cliches) so if thats worrying you then be at ease. The game has 3 main routes, but I’d highly recommend starting with the Black Eagles route first, as there are some extra story details there not found in other routes."

These troll scores being made by children that cant handle the fact that their preferred console doesn't have the exclusives the Switch has been getting flooded with lately is pathetic.

However, the game doesn't live up to the hype and if you're not into the social simulator aspect or a huge fan of Tactical RPGs, you'll probably find this game to be pretty average.

The best part of this game is not only the fact that it has a pretty good story completely filled with hours and hours of voice acting (with pretty good English VAs, especially for the House leaders) but the fact that it has branching stories based upon which House you choose at the beginning.

But, the game is bogged down by several things: awful textures that make the game look like it belongs on PS2, a class system that has neither quality nor quantity (Oh, you're a black mage? Here's an advanced class for you. Oh, you're a white mage? Here's..... the same class. You've gone from Archer to Sniper? You're.. slightly better with a bow now,) The only time class changes actually feel significant is when you switch to a mount.

Since the gameplay alternates between roaming the monastery doing menial things and subpar combat, it was hard to be interested enough in getting through the story.

If you watch videos online and you like the social simulator aspect, don't mind the graphics, and are either a die-hard fan of Tactical RPGs or just want to give one a try, you'll probably like this game."

Lots of personal relationships.   One thing that amazed me is that every character can have meaningful interactions with every other character. Many of the meetings between characters are poignant, informative or LOL funny.  Have Bernadette the shy girl talk to Sylvian the flirt.    The back story is one of the few game stories I have ever cared about.  There is mystery, politics and a real sense of loss.

It is the first fire emblem game I have played so I can’t compare it to those, but I loved how it essentially felt like two games that were affecting one another. Walking around the school and learning about all the characters was interesting in itself, and whilst the quests were a bit dull and repetitive, they were pretty quick to complete. The great thing about learning about the characters is you feel a connection, and it’s even more devastating when one dies. The battles are great fun and I felt were fair but easy to be punished if you’re not paying attention. If you’re a newbie to the series like myself I’d recommend playing on normal difficulty first, not so much for the battles but it’s more forgiving if you have been leveling your characters wrong. Replayabiliy is high. I have now completed it on both normal and hard with two different houses, and I’m looking forward to playing another run through. The only thing I would say is missing is a skirmish mode or multiplayer versus, but there’s still plenty of game here to make it an easy 10."

  ",9,"So before I start my review, I want to mention I have played 150 hours of the game and in that time I have beaten Black Eagles and Blue Lions Routes on Hard/Classic and started Golden Deer with the same difficulty.   I personally like going over all aspects of the game to determine how I feel it is good. First, lets talk about gameplay, I feel that Fire Emblem Three Houses has done a great job with the gameplay so far in this game. The combat is great and benefits  from how you can customize your students classes, abilities, combat arts, adjutants, and battalions. I also enjoyed tutoring my students and the different ways you can fill up their motivations (Dining, gifts, supports, seminars, battles, resting, and lost items) which dictates how much they can learn. All of these combine to form a brilliant Strategy RPG experience that rewards you for planning. Enemies in this game are great especially the Beasts that require to you to make smart uses of gambits and combat arts to take them down. Other than that, I known some people will complain about Divine Pulse, a feature that allows you to turn back time to redo a turn but I think since it is an optional mechanic it doesn’t hurt the difficulty of the game as you can choose not to use.

Second, the story of the Black Eagles, Blue Lions, and Golden Deer are very different which is amazing. Sure there may be similarities with some of the cutscenes and locations/maps that are used but usually staring position, enemy types, and enemy placements are changed although there are exceptions to this. However, the exceptions don’t change the fact that each House presents new information due to the characters you meet and use that you wouldn’t learn otherwise unless you played another route. This game is also written well in my opinion and the great voice acting I feel pushes that point even further. The only criticism I have for the story is you don’t get many choices that alter then story but the story is good overall so I am fine with it.

Third, the music of Fire Emblem has always been great and Three Houses is no different. I don’t have much to say it is amazing.

Fourth, graphics in this game are not amazing but I wouldn’t say they are terrible. I think the character models and buildings looked great but for some reason plants, and grass did not look as good. However, this doesn’t stop the game from being fun in my mind so I would say it is not a problem. In conclusion, I would say Fire Emblem Three Houses is an amazing game that is easily 9/10. Please ignore people hating on the game and giving it a zero as I feel their opinion does not reflect the actual value of the game."

  ",9,"The game is massive and has a lot of interesting mechanics. The only reason I give it 9 instead of 10 is that it's extremely easy on normal mode (even with classic style) mainly because of divine pulse and exp retain after retreat from battle. That last option is horrible (it is present only in normal mode) and pointless. I've seen a lot of people complain about it on forums. I played The Sacred Stones (GBA) and Radiant Dawn (Wii) on normal modes and they were perfect. After about 15 hours of playing Three Houses I regretted not choosing hard mode since there is no option of changing the difficulty mode to higher. After some time you simply don't want to engage in interesting mechanics, such as seminars, battalions, finding lost items from online players, because you can just lose any battle 2 or 3 times, retain gained exp and easily win another time. To developers: please at least remove the exp retain option from normal mode to make the game more engaging. I know that I can play on hard but most players will not want to play again from the beginning after several hours of playing when they discover that normal mode is pointless. If you remove this option, or at least make other changes to make the game unique mechanics more engaging, I'll give the game 10 and buy the season pass, I promise ;)"

  ",9,"As a relative newcomer to the Fire Emblem series, with Awakening being my first entry, I've been a fan ever since, and could not wait to see what this one had to offer.  After having just completed it and clocking in just over 90 hours, I can safely say Three Houses is one of the best games this year.
The gameplay and combat manages to remain consistently fun and enjoyable throughout.  The combat has this smooth transition from the overhead view to the units fighting on the battlefield that makes it all so engaging to watch unfold.  With the addition of the Officers Academy, you're really going to have to think about what you want to accomplish: do you want to improve your main character, build support with your students and allies, or dive into some auxiliary battles?  You can't do it all, so you'll have to choose which gives the gameplay another added layer.  Each character has their own unique personality, really good design, and top notch voice acting.  They'll form relationships with each other for better or worse, and not one of those characters I did not like, and in fact came to actually care for them.  There is definitely a lot of replayability here since the stories for each house will be vastly different from each other and diverge into their own path, so it encourages you to play through a second, and third time to get the full scope of the story.  The music, of course, is absolutely fantastic and will certainly put you into the mood for each fight.  All of these great qualities really come together and give you a very memorable experience.
The game is not without flaws, and there are a few of them.  To get this out of the way, I will say this about the graphics: They’re absolutely not the best; however, I liked them so I don’t consider them a flaw, but I feel others will find the game graphically rough around the edges, so it is something to consider.  Second, navigating the menus can be confusing and frustrating.  What should have felt intuitive instead felt cumbersome, so you may get lost or find it irritating to find and use an item.  Finally, the game is too easy.  I understood that starting on Normal Classic was probably the best bet for someone still new to the series, but not once did I feel challenged and was able to breeze through each fight.  The game isn’t perfect, but these flaws shouldn’t drastically hamper your experience.
Fire Emblem: Three Houses is such a fantastic game that no Switch owner should pass on.  Whether you’re a veteran or new to the series, I know you’ll have as much of an experience playing through it as I did.  There is so much here for you to do, and will last you many hours of gameplay.  Don’t hesitate and pick this one up….House Black Eagles all the way!"

  ",7,"I love fire emblem. After completing a single playthough, thoroughly exhausted and not willing to jump back in for more, I'm left with a single, resounding impressing. 3 houses is... a very gamey game.

The mechanics of combat maintain their lineage, with the notable exceptions being removal of the weapon triangle and spell tomes (spells now have a limited number of casts per map), but if you've ever seen combat in a fire emblem game before, you've seen it in this one too. It's good, but the same thing we've seen before; it's starting to suffer from the same lack of evolution that the pokemon games have.

The story of the game, on the other hand, is an initially interesting departure from series form, and takes place almost entirely in the monastery castle and classroom halls. A vaguely hogwarts like affair with 3 competing houses takes place, with your character having to choose which of the houses to tutor as professor of the house. Depending on the house chosen and several key decisions made over the course of your tenure at the monestary, the story will diverge and branch out into one of several unique paths, each with their own unique story and ending.

Whilst I praise the approach of attempting to tell multiple stories within the same game, mechanically the story tell and exploration sections of the game are incredibly mechanical. Whether it's the act of tutoring your students by choosing key areas of study for the week, or running around the monastery fishing in the same spot for the 4th time this month, the game lacks any serious depth in any one of its systems; before long, you'll start to notice the cogs literally turning as you have tea with your favorite student for the 3rd time in a day, or attempt to give another student every single lost item in your inventory until hitting the correct one for that reputation gain. It's all very menu driven and feels like picking from a set of favorite preferences toward the same end, rather than making important tactical decision. Its all very... gamey. Nothing feels organic or earned, it's just ticking off events, listening to (practically) one way conversations, delivering piles of presents to curry favor, or performing a stupid QTE fishing game. None of the mechanics jump out at me as interesting design choices.

It's not a bad game; combat is fine, with as much tactical depth as any other fire emblem. The addition of divine pulses to turn back the turn clock to redo actions is a welcome escape from the hard reset to avoid a key character death. It's just that what is good is just the same thing we've seen in FE before, and whats new isn't very engaging, despite its initial promise.

I will say that the cast of students contains some great personalities; I would much have gathered battles and events focusing more around student affairs than the grand political stage as time progresses.

Overall I give it a decent 7/10, with a recommendation only for those whom are either new to FE or those who truly hold FE close to their hearts, and again only if you've 40 or so hours to spare. For others looking for solid turn based strategies, I'd recommend XCOM2."

  ",9,"Three Houses changes a lot of the things the Fire Emblem franchise is known for, such as drastically altering the class system, getting rid of the child unit system from Awakening and Fates, and featuring a lot of non-combat gameplay where you walk around an academy and instruct your students. The addition of Battalions during combat provides new strategic options, and the many skills you can learn and equip to your units allow you to customize your army to your liking. Likewise, the addition of Combat Arts, special attack that grant bonus effects in exchange for reducing weapon durability, add a neat option where you can increase combat efficiency at the cost of your resources.
The only issue I have with the game is that the beginning of the game can be rather slow, making repeat playthroughs to see the different routes feel boring at first.
Overall, a fantastic addition to the Fire Emblem franchise."

It starts you off with interesting well developed characters and an incredible story line that is somewhat predictable but is still interesting.
This game takes you on wild ride of emotions and feelings that you never thought were in you before. I haven't even fully completed the game yet  and I can already tell that this gaming experience has been one of the best if not the gaming experience I ever had.
The story is wild and crazy and each character has his/her own unique traits and ambitions which makes every run feel unique and special!
The game has a lot of self aware and the developers aren't afraid to show that off. I never expected coming into this game and getting so emotionally attached to all of the characters (well most of the characters). I highly suggest you to go and buy this game if you want to get yourself into the fire emblem world with one of its best releases in years! Recommend to all of the RPG fans and the Hare core weebs.

  ",10,"A really good game and I would recommend it to anyone with a switch. Features branching story lines and options to let you customize your experience. This game definitely took notes from Persona 5 (in a good way) and put their own twists on it in terms of discovering more about the people in your house and the exploration of the monastery. The combat system is polished and provides a solid challenge for those who are looking for it on the hard difficulty and classic. Some of the things I wish they expanded on were more options for the master classes (maybe something like a custom master class), and perhaps another option for things to do on Sunday to add to the Explore/Seminar/Combat. Regardless, this game will most likely be considered a must have for the switch and the people giving it a 0 are simply looking too hard at the past Fire Emblem games instead of rating this one on it's own merits."

  ",3,"Let me preface by saying - I have been playing Fire Emblem since Path of Radiance. Been playing RPGs since NES. I have never reviewed a video game before, and created an account specifically for this. Love Fire Emblem series... or should I say I used to? Below is my breakdown on this game:

Pros:
-Nice graphics.
-Fun additions to battles, including specialized items, new job class promotion routes, and gambits.
-Interesting new main plot storyline with fun characters and an interesting, fresh setting.

Cons:
-Exploring is tedious. Monastery feels like an early beta release. If you are obsessive like me, you will comb this monastery many many times over looking for insignificant items, only to inexplicably miss a support or story line item because it's not clear what conversation choices will be received well

-A high focus on cheesy, terrible relationship building and chatter that is absolutely miserable to follow. This seems geared towards a small niche of people.

-Side jobs that could be fun - gardening, fishing, building your professor ranking - seems interesting at first. Gardening is a chore with no finesse, fishing feels rushed and has no interest, and bears very little reward. Tournaments are simple - throw your strongest character in regardless of weapon (Or magic user) and smash B button to make it go fast. Also very little reward.

-Character progression ends on some truly odd ""Master classes"". Sword and magic? Reason based attack classes? These demand you be poor at multiple skills instead of good or great at any one.

-Tea time; Seminars; Instruction; weekly tasks; these are all a complete drag.

-Shorter significant story line, which I suppose is supplemented by multiple houses (Storyline playthroughs) and all the dating-game nonsense? I hope you liked scumming the monastery for items and conversations 15+ times on your first playthrough, because there are more playthroughs after that.

-Very, very easy.

Summary: The main storyline has some fun aspects and battle is neat, albeit easy. But know that you are buying more of an anime dating game rather than a legitimate, gritty, difficult entry into what was an amazing series. My suggestion: Don't waste your money."

  ",10,"I created an account just to write a review for FE:3H. This is my first FE game and the first game in NSW (so far) that had me doing new game+.

As I mentioned above, I haven't played previous FE games, so I wouldn't know how to compare the older ones with this one. That said, this game is really fun - it's a cross between a Japanese visual novel type of game and a turn-based strategy JRPG. You basically have a gameplay cycle that let's you manage your time between building relationships, trainings, battles and missions - I'm in NG+ and I'm still not getting bored with this cycle.

The story is compelling enough to make you want to go thru each of the houses just to see their point of view, meet the characters and watch how their story ends. I'm not saying it's perfect story-wise, but for a game, man, you will want to go thru all the route just to understand the characters moral drive.

I'm on route 2, and seeing myself doing until route 4 (with a break in between probably for other games). And will definitely buy the expansion pass to see the (I assume), good ending."

Despite how heavy storytelling the game is, the narrative is not good enough to make me want to know everything in the game. Many questions that they introduced at the very beginning of the game, they answered the question very poorly.  But I have to admit that even with its poor narrative, I still want to replay the game just to know what really happened in the other routes. There are 4 routes in the game, btw.

  ",5,"I am overall very disappointed in this title but dont let my 5/10 score deter you from trying it yourself as some of what I dislike about it many will like and see as positives. I have been very disappointed with almost all fire emblems since radiant dawn on the wii. Fire emblem path of radiance is the pinnacle of this series as well as fire emblem 4 geneology of the holy war but now since the success of awakening on 3ds the focus of the fire emblem games has shifted in a direction I could not care less about. I see fire emblem as strategy games with unit customisation and military style stories with perhaps some magic and fantasy mixed in. However as years have gone by they are turning them into silly dating/life sim/ strategy games. I like the strategy but none of the rest. The game constantly buries you in mind numbingly boring busy work that you need to click through to get to the meat of the game which is the battles and main story segments. As each new fire emblem title comes out there seems to be more and more fat added on and less and less meat. This is the current state of fire emblem 3 houses, half a strategy game with interesting story (it actually is a cool story ) and half boring meaningless chit chat, teaching, fishing, gardening, singing and ...jesus......what were they thinking! so 5/10 seems fair to me, half the game is good, half is bad. Oh and dont get me started on adding in a rewind mechanic if you make a mistake. No more careful pondering over your decisions, just try whatever you like, its fine, if you die you can rewind. can turn permadeath off too, just as that was introduced in the 3ds titles, another unwelcome edition,"

None of them feel like they are just reused tropes you find in anime or JRPG's. Even characters who start out seeming like terrible people have more sides to them than what you see at first. The combat feels just like Fire Emblem should. It's been tweaked to look nice on the Switch but other than that it's still Fire Emblem and honestly why fix what's not broken?

Fire Emblem returns back to the home TV screen in full glory with HD visuals, fully voiced characters, true free roam, and several story paths and character journeys to be discovered based on your choices. The feeling of having a group of students made the game feel so personal, giving me what felt like my own cast of main characters to go on this journey with. I quickly found myself addicted to every support conversation, trying to see what each and every wonderful character would say to one another, flushing this already vast world out even more. I could never leave a single text bubble unchecked, a meal skipped, or reject a tea time because I loved the cast so much. To think of how the developers crafted several unique journeys each with their own casts packed into one game, with different causes to fight for all just from which house you choose to teach... Truly this game must have been a dream come true for the creators, even more so than Fates was.

I have nothing but praises to sing for this game. I do feel as though there are bits of the story I'm missing, but that goes into the replay-ability factor of this game. I plan on diving deep into another playthrough to see if I can unravel some mysteries, meet a new main cast, share a new goal... I'm ready to do this all over again, even if it means I have to find more Lost Items. If you haven't picked up this amazing game yet, you're missing out on a great journey (or more) just for you."

Larger customization of characters and their classes, as well as varied objectives and enemies in combat, ensures the game remains exciting. The new game plus mode also offers enough in the way of new features to keep you coming back for another play-through. The only thing preventing it from a perfect score is the story.

Which yet another brand new storyline with impressive and diverse characters, everything that is held dear about this franchise beats through to the player while managing to subvert expectations at every turn. Each character you interact with has a fresh personality and intriguing backstory that just learning about the characters makes it hard to put the Switch down and when I do, I find myself just thinking about everything going on anyway. The combat is surprisingly attention grabbing, with the iconic war strategy that makes the series such a strong staple in the Nintendo library. As the game progresses however I found the game missing important story beats due to the nature of how cutscenes are done; obviously this is probably a limitation due to having such a wide branching narrative between three different key story choices but as you progress to Part Two you notice a lack of pre-rendered cutscenes, replaced by the less vibrant “two characters standing at arms length just talking” style that makes it a little difficult to engage in the emotional beats it’s throwing at you.

I'm so glad I went with the hype on this one because yes it is a very deep game, but it never seems that it's too much to deal with.  It's all pretty manageable and early hours of the game do a fine job of helping you understand how things are done and from there on out it's pretty routine.  After only 7 hours of gameplay I would give this game somewhere between a B+ or an A- ...so I guess a 9/10.  But this could easily become a 10/10 as things continue.  The combat is simply amazing, and I'm really beginning to enjoy the character development, and relationships with the students, and I thought for sure that would be something I wouldn't enjoy much.

For anyone who's not familiar about the Fire Emblem series and want to get into the game, this is a really good game to jump into, It have a beginner friendly mode where you can choose to prevent permanent death and it does not require you to play the previous installment to know the story since Three Houses is pretty much a stand alone game without any reference from the pass Fire Emblem games. With the addition of the monastery in the latest installment of Fire Emblem, it give players the freedom to interact with your favorite characters, doing side quest and leveling up your stats. The monastery could feel a little overwhelming at first, but it won't be long before the players get used to it. Unlike the previous Fire Emblem games, you are given much more freedom in term of selecting what classes you want to assign your units and there isn't to much of a restriction which I for once welcome the change. In Three Houses they have add in many more addition to the gameplay, one of the example is the addition of ""Adjutant"" which is a new gameplay mechanics that was not in the previous Fire Emblem series which you are allowed to assign this adjutant to accompany your units into battles. As for the story in the games goes, without spoiling anything it is as good as it can get which is what you would normally expect from a Fire Emblem game. There's a lot of replay value for the game as well since there's a total of three houses to pick from and with each of their own unique stories and endings.

  ",9,"A handful of performance issues and some painful lack of anti-aliasing are the only real quibbles I have technically for what is truly a masterful title with a LOT of replayability.  When Nintendo claimed there was 200 hours of content in this game, they (perhaps unbelievably) might have been UNDER-selling it.

Narratively, it is a BIT basic in the sense that there's no REAL massive surprises in that no one side of the struggle is entirely right, and it's a type of structuring that we've seen many times before in games.  But Three Houses excels in the execution of that framework.  Regardless of the path you choose, and regardless of the perspectives you've experienced before, it is very easy to become wholly invested on the path in front of you.

The only quibble I have is that the real ""villains"" of the story seem to exist only to be villains.  They don't seem to have any particularly compelling reason to be in the story at all other than to do terrible things that no one else would do.  It felt entirely unnecessary, and I feel like the game should have either committed to them or cut them entirely.

All in all, there is nothing that Fire Emblem: Three Houses does that hasn't really been done before in the medium.  There's nothing that I felt was completely unique or original, either in the technical presentation, the gameplay, or the story.  However, it DOES put those pieces together in exceptional fashion, and anyone who likes these sort of turn-based style RPGs should enjoy this game immensely.

For people who have never experienced the series before (because it had been a handheld exclusive series), there really is no better way to introduce yourself to it.  It earns every bit of a 9/10 and I would recommend it to any RPG fan without reservation."

Teaching all my students how I wanted to teach them was a fun and new aspect of the game I can really appreciate. Also in onl school for emblem manor S support with your units can result in a love/marriage scene that I can really appreciate. The style and the way the game is played out makes it unique and fun to play again and again trying all 3 houses.

  ",7,"Well where to start.. Just finished the game (Golden Deer route) and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I've been waiting for a console FE ever since the Tellius games so it is not an understatement to say the hypetrain was REAL when they announced Three Houses. After finishing this game in about 2 weeks my opinion of it is generally positive, altough I do have some pretty big issues with a few elements. I guess Ill just list them all:

Gameplay
The gameplay is goddamn amazing and classic Fire Emblem with some extra mechanics to keep it fresh. I absolutely love the way they implemented the skill and ability system, they felt really thought out and added some extra tactical choices during combat. I also liked how magic is handled in this game, the unit hets a set amount of magic uses per fight and it automatically replenishes after the chapter has ended. This way the amount of weapon maintenance you have to do is greatly lessened, which is very much appreciated.

Story
The story for me felt a little bit underwhelming, maybe I need to play all 3 routes to get the full experience but for now I am not very impressed. It is your typical good guys vs evil empire story with a few twists I saw coming from a mile away. none of it felt very fresh and at times I noticed I did not really care all that much which is a shame because this series is capable of telling amazing stories like the Tellius games for example.

Characters
The character writing was okay, I liked a few characters but at the same time some felt really flat and generic to me. I watch a lot of anime so I immediately recognised the typical anime-quirks like the 'shy girl' and the 'always hungry guy'. I did really like the character of Claude and his arc though so it is a mixed bag for me. The avatar character was boring, not much more to say on that.

Some problems I had:

The castle/calendar system worked really well in the beginning but got really really stupid after the time skip.. Waiting a whole month between each event made no sense story wise and I wish they would have implemented another mechanic to replace the calendar witch just a normal base to prepare between battles (like in the Tellius games. made way more sense and gave a feeling of urgency and momentum.) Or maybe do multiple mission events during the month instead of just one at the end each time.

Another problem I had was the difficulty, I found this game to be extremely easy. SO much that it made me bored sometimes during battles because my army was so damn OP I could just slaughter the enemy without much thought. I know it might be easier for me since I played a lot of FE games but when I breeze though a game even on hard classic mode they really need to balance the game better.

And lastly the level design felt really uninspired to me, aside from a few memorable maps they all felt really 'meh' to me. They had so much opportunity to implement some creative maps with cool objectives like maybe a 'capture the flag' type of chapter or puzzles or anything other than 'defeat enemy captain'... Like really 9/10 chapters is just either rout the enemy or defeat the commander. This combined with uninspired level design made some chapters kinda boring and the only thing that kept me going was the amazing battle mechanics.

So, even though I have some issues I really enjoyed the game overall. I hope this entry will re-awaken the love for console FE games and I really really hope the developers will do some creative stuff next game. And please GIVE US A FULL MAIN CHARACTER GAIN .. Im tired of these soulless avatars :("

  ",8,"I've played through the Black Eagles and Golden Deer paths, and can say with certainty that OVERALL this is my favorite FE title. My only gripes with the game are that in the monastery, the game does not look or perform as well as I'd like it to, and in the normal Black Eagle path the story drops multiple plot threads as it transitions into the second act. However, the Golden Deer answers these questions by the end of it's story. This game truly shines in the characters and TBSRPG gameplay. My personal favorite parts of any Fire Emblem is the camaraderie that the army you've amassed shares, which in Three Houses is only made stronger with the cut down party size from previous games. This may be disappointing to those who liked to have large armies, but pays off through how tight knit the crew is, as opposed to in previous titles where the army at best knows each other very loosely outside of the 3-5 main characters. Three Houses introduces multiple quality of life changes and additions to the Turn-Based Strategy gameplay; Nothing groundbreaking but enough to push it into the most enthralling the series has to offer. I have yet to play through the Blue Lions and the secret route, but with 90 hours logged I can say this is a fantastic addition for fans of the series."

The Blue Kions ending was great, as Dimitri was best boi

The Church route, was cliche honestly, and while it was powerful, it didnt touch me the way the others did,

But the way that Edelgard was written, the way the war played out, how everyone was fleshed out, It felt great. You can tell this was probably supposed to be the big ending, I do wish Dimitri did live, but thats the beauty of this game;

Its written froma human standpoint. Not everyone will live. Every other Fire emblem was cliche, in the sense that you just battle and battle, the ramifications of war really never showed unless you lost a unit, but here, youre grown to all the units, you bond with them, and then in the second part, you are forced to fight and kill them"

  ",9,"Ok this review is in the context of Fire Emblem games.

The game is awesome! I'm 40 hours in and loving it. So if you're on the fence about this one, get it! You won't regret it.
The strategy gameplay is on point, this is the first time I'm playing this game on hard, and for veterans of the series I really recommend it, it keeps every fight really exiting.

There's so much to do in between fights, but if you're really not into that you can skip most of those activities. Visually the game is not impressive, but it works well enough. Fights are really fast and fluid.

This is my 4th game on the series so I'm not confident in saying this is the best, but is certainly my favorite so far.

I'm docking a point because there are things on the UI that could be improved, starting with font size, it's way too small. There are so much information on the screen at any given moment, it's overwhelming sometimes, I feel like I'm just getting the hang of everything. But that's just a minor gripe with an otherwise fantastic game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any strategy or JRPG fan."

  ",5,"This game is my biggest disappointment of the year; possibly one of the biggest disappointments I have had from a video game. The gameplay itself is good; the core Fire Emblem gameplay is still fun and the monastery exploration is an interesting idea. However, the story is dreadful. It makes very little sense and just feels half baked. The characters themselves are mostly likeable but it all just feels very...dull. The timeskip halfway through completely put me off the game; with it feeling like the whole first half of the game was simply a waste of time. There are some highlights in the game and for those who have never played Fire Emblem before, you will probably like this game. But, it just doesn't  work for me. Awakening  is my favourite of all time and Fates was very good (despite the multiple stories). Three Houses tries to incorporate 4 separate routes but none of them feel right. It leads to a lot of replayability but if you don't want to play them to start with; they have failed. The main character is a lifeless shell and the story becomes so convoluted and just downright daft that I have had to stop my playthrough. I have played 38 hours of Fire Emblem Three Houses, waiting for that moment where the game clicks. It has not clicked, this game is not for me and not for fans of the older games (GBA era and before). If your new to the series, buy this game. If you're not, go in with lower expectations than I did. Then you won't end up quite as annoyed as I."

  ",10,"This game brings the series to a happy medium between the waifu 3DS games and the more serious oldschool entries, as well as SoV. While the graphics leave room for improvement, I never felt anything was too outrageously bad. The models of the characters are excellent despite no AA. At the time of writing I am about to enter the timeskip. The teaching portion of the game has been absolutely enjoyable every step of the way. The diversity in the gameplay will keep you invested, from exploring the monestary, tutoring, or battling. Voice acting for the characters in English dub is professionally done, as well as translation from what I can tell. You can thank Nintendo for not giving this job to Treehouse again. The support conversations are nowhere near as bad as fates, but deliver the same amount of tropes you'd expect. Character design and art direction for the characters and their classes is remarkably thematic. There are no more over designed ""maid with a battle axe in a cage dress"" ladies or ""backstreet boys reject"" looking lords. This was what swayed me to buying this game to begin with. Shadows of Valentia is presentation perfection, and I'm glad to see some of that has rubbed off on this game. Classes feel remarkably balanced as of mid game. The music is appropriate to the moments in the game but has not left a song in my head. I felt surprised by some characters I ""like"" that I didn't previously anticipate to care for. There is a lot of love put into this game and I highly recommend it to any series fan, or those into tactics and visual novel games."

  ",8,"I was a bit  skeptical at first to buy this game, because I played fire emblem awakening and I didn’t like it. However this is way better than I expected. Just the fact that you can customize each of your students to fit to your needs is done very well. The story is great too. I’ve not gotten far into the story yet I think. I hope not, because I don’t want it to end... haha. I will try the two other faction/houses after I’m done with one I playing with now.

What I miss is the possibility to change the appearance of your character. Being able to change everything, eyes, hair, clothes and more. There is DLC they were you can buy to get additional clothing, but I think at least give us the option the change the hair and the face. With details and so on. That’s why it doesn’t get a 10/10 from me. The gameplay is very fun and it’s rewarding to see how your ensamble of characters evolve and become even deep. You can even invite other students into your house from the other factions.That’s great. I love that. All in all, you can get into this without prior knowledge about the franchise or lore. I enjoy that, newbie friendly but still deep and complex at the same time. I’m now looking forward to the next entry in the series. Please give us more options to create a character from the ground up like other RPG games has done in the past."

  ",10,"FE Three Houses reinvented the series. The game feels new and exciting unlike Fates which was trying too hard to be Awakening 2.0. Considering how terrible the writing was for Fates, I wasn't expecting much from Three Houses. The negative reviews on the site also got me questioning if I even wanted to buy the game, but I did and I'm glad I did. The story is so much darker than I thought it would be and the support conversations are a lot more interesting than the ones in previous installments. I absolutely love the characters. They feel a lot more fleshed out and those in your house stay relevant as the story progresses. While the beginning is a bit slow, it definitely picks up in the second part.

The gameplay is standard for FE games, but I do think this installment is easier than the others because of a certain mechanism that allows you to rewind time. The maps are fun with the addition of new kinds of enemies. Also, life at the monastery gives you plenty of new things to do like cooking, fishing, dining, etc. The quests can be a bit tedious, but I do enjoy what this aspect of the game has to offer.

It took me about 50 hours to finish my first play-through, but I'm definitely not done with the game. Each route leaves a few questions that can only be answered by playing through the others. I can easily see myself devoting days of nonstop playing to complete the rest of the routes. In my opinion, Fire Emblem Three Houses is certainly worth the $60."

  ",10,"I'm just going to put this out there: Most of the reviews that give a 0 out of 10 are either from salty old-school fans who decided the game was trash without even playing it as evident with how they lament that ""the waifus and husbandos take over the game"" even though the avatar is the only character that even CAN marry and there hasn't even been a single fan service scene that I encountered 80 hours into the game, or leftover some passing salty Smash Bros fans who got too annoyed by the marketing push.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses had a RIDICULOUS amount of effort put into it. An entire Persona-like time management mechanic was integrated into the game in a manner that if you had never played another game in the Franchise before, you'd swear it's as it was always supposed to be.

With several branching paths actually coming up to the length of- as far as I've heard from people even further along than me- the very exaggerated sounding 200 hours promised, and characters that have actual depth and motivation to them this time as well as the feeling of ""No matter what you do, in some ways you definitely are a bad guy"" the plot gives you, It's genuinely up there with the greatest of the franchise such as Genealogy of the Holy War (In terms of tone it's actually quite similar to that one in the second half...).

All in all, I kept my expectations in check after Fates, but this game has restored my faith in the franchise completely. It is different than before, yes, but sometimes change is good, guys!

It’s quite approachable without knowing much about previous games. I really enjoy the battle system, but what keeps me so engaged is the diversity in gameplay. There are battles of course, but you also spend time leveling up your professor level which helps you accomplish more each week. The relationships between you and your students are actually engaging, I feel like you get what you put into it in terms of character arcs. So far, I feel the diverse game play, compelling stories, and enjoyable battling and leveling system make this a wonderful entry point for newcomers.

  ",9,"Before I properly get into this I need to address some of the lunacy from trolls rating this a 0. Firstly: no this is not a dating sim game anywhere near to the extent of Awakening or Fates. One character can get married and it happens at the end of the game. Plus you can always ignore that feature. Secondly: of course the game has anime-like designs. It's a Japanese game made by a Japanese company for a Japanese console. Look at the old design of Marth and you'll see that Fire Emblem has long had designs similar to anime trends.

Now, the game itself is phenomenal. While battles often lack the complexity of the Conquest route of Fates, the challenge ramps up nicely as you get more used to how the game is played. Generally you take 10-12 units on the field and thank merciful Christ the pair-up mechanic is gone! The Divine Pulse mechanic is useful for reversing mistakes or countering unlucky critical hits on your characters but again, you are more than welcome to ignore it for the more classic Fire Emblem experience. The new combat arts and battalion mechanics add an extra layer of thought to battles as you weigh up whether to potentially take a hit to double attack or use a gambit to do less damage but debuff the enemy and guarantee not getting counter-attacked. Fire orbs, ballistae and onagers make a return allowing massive ranged attacks on your troops thus demanding aggressiveness where you may wish to play defensive. Luckily you can return the favour straight back at your enemies.

Next we come to Garret Mach Monastery which is the central hub of the world. Each calendar month gives several opportunities to teach, give seminars, explore, battle or rest to restore students motivation. If you're so inclined you can ignore all of that but doing so does yourself and the game a massive disservice. While the mechanics are usually just voiceless cutscenes, seminars and lessons improve the skills of your units and here is where the two gameplay styles of the game come together beautifully. Exploring allows you to interact with your units and build further support or engage in lessons from faculty to improve your own skills. There's nothing particularly incredible on the mechanics but it gives the opportunity to briefly chat with units about events. As a premise they can build on this in the next title and out some more meat on the bones.


You can take a unit strong in swords for instance and focus on sword lessons for him to become a swordmaster and have him perform excellently on the battlefield. Or you can put a little more effort in teaching him magic to train him into a mortal savant later in the game this making him far more versatile and covering enemy types with high defense. You can take a character destined to be a Paladin and turn her into a warlock and you can do this with every single character if you wish with varying degrees of success. I myself replaced a dead warlock by doing this and later reclassing them into a holy knight to get the best of both worlds. This is by far the most customisable your units have ever been in Fire Emblem and you have a lot of freedom to experiment.

The story is by no means groundbreaking (I've only finished one playthrough at 68 hours however) but it is a huge step up from the simplicity of Awakening and the utter garbage of Fates. There are definitely still hideous and relentlessly evil characters but the major antagonists of the second half are often just enemies of circumstance whose motivations run opposite to yours. It's not particularly nuanced but it certainly tells a deeper story than many of the 'heroes of light vs irredeemable evil' story tropes of most of the prior titles.

On the negative side, some of the missions at least on hard mode can be tests of trial and error more than strategy. On the Blue Lions side two missions in particular had enemy placements that seem to require a slow methodical approach to avoid being overwhelmed while simultaneously having units with absurd attack range basically demanding you to charge to avoid taking 30+ or even 40+ damage a turn that you have no defense against. It's always possible to place your units and pick your attacks to finish missions without deaths but missions like this didn't require me to strategize as much as just pray RNG was in my favour.
The framerate is also not very stable when there's fire effects going on in the background leading the game to stagger and chug a little. Not game breaking but definitely jarring To cut a very long story short this is an absolute must-own for fans on grid-based tactical games like Xcom. Fire Emblem has truly never been better and I can't wait to start my other two playthroughs"

  ",8,"Main Takeaway: I'd say it's a very solid entry into the Fire Emblem franchise. Not perfect, but, to me, worth the large investment of time it takes to play it through to the end.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses offers a solid storyline seen through one of three nation-aligned houses in a warrior-school, knight-creating Hogwarts. Although I only played through one of the three possible houses, I was given an emotional, well-written (if strangely paced) experience that I definitely enjoyed.

The biggest positives of the game for me were:

- The updated tactics system that did away with the rock-paper-scissors style of previous Fire Emblem entries.
- The level of faith the writing had in the intelligence of its audience, dropping more terminology, names, and locations than many previous games.
- The game's willingness to tackle topics of politics, fealty, religion, war, and the unique perspectives one could have on any one of those issues.
- The depth given to characters that seem extremely gimmicky at first, but have meaningful and believable motivations once their personal stories and interactions are explored.
- A very interesting and emotionally rewarding way of separating chapters and acts.

The biggest negatives of the game for me were:

- The sometimes strange pacing, both in the story and in the functional aspects of the game (if you plan well, you may run out of things to put time into while exploring the 'home' area far sooner than you'd imagine, leaving completionists or people who like unlocking/exploring feeling a little empty for the latter stages of the game).
- The writing frequently falls into exposition tropes, particularly of the 'I have something important to tell you, but only after this next thing' variety.
- The full CG stills seem much lower in quality compared to the character busts, and they somewhat drain from the emotion intended during their scenes.

All in all, I had a good time while playing this game, even if, by the end stages, I was mostly speeding through the story as I had exhausted all of the other features. It isn't perfect enough to get me to invest the time into exploring the other two houses and their paths, but at no point did I feel like I had wasted my time playing it. I suggest checking it out."

  ",7,"First of all, there are so many things that are good about this, and a few things that prevent me from really saying its one of the better titles.

First of all, the different houses are a very unique idea, think kind of like harry potter classrooms, etc, but in fire emblem. You become the teacher for one of the houses, and can train students the way you want to use them in battle. There is a nice little open roam element, and there is an online setting, if someone has fallen in combat on a specific tile, it can create an xp or gear tile for someone else playthrough. Likewise if one of your units is defeated, it will create one of the tiles for another player. This is a unique element and I actually think its a good one!

There is also a new brigade system, which reinforces your units with extra abilities that can help others out, this is also a neat system that hasn't been done before. The cutscenes also have the same quality as the CGI from the 2016 berserk series, which means they are relatively well done!

Now the bad... First, I really do not like the character design, I think its one of the weakest character designs in the franchise. Most characters have the same color hair as their iris, which gives them a creepy feel. Some just look weird/creepy to begin with. I would say half just look odd, and the others look natural, I could get into a list of things for each character, but too long for a review.

Frankly, my biggest complaint is the sheer amount of solider's I can bring into battle. I am a bit of an impatient person, so when I have to control 20 students at the same time, it gets a bit annoying. I would prefer for them to go back to the system from awakening/fates.

Also the bond system is not nearly as good as it was in previous entries. I think fire emblem fates actually had the best bonding system out of all of them, but that's just me. Overall, I do like the game, I have sunk 20+ hours into the game and continue to enjoy it... but its not anywhere close to my favorite fire emblem game."

The gameplay got improved with the special skills, and being bond to certain weapons or classes on your characters gives you the chance to actually build the army you wish for.

They really invested in the support conversations, since there are a ton of them, every character has a a couple of special scenes (or even more) with everyone else, making it virtually impossible to get them all on a single run, making every person's experience different from others, and adding more replay value.

Fire Emblem Hogwarts was a risky gamble, and it nailed it. Probably not the best Fire Emblem ever, but it is pretty close to it."

The ability to travel the entire school and interact with the students and instruct them is wonderful. The combat is so well thought out. I do think that taking away the weapon triangle is good in some ways and bad in others, but still so well put together. The use of battalions is unique and even adding monster battles to it is a nice change. It's like they took a strategy game and combined it with an MMO or RPG. It's wonderful.

The ONLY reason this isn't a 10 is that you lose the ability to customize your avatar and the graphics threw me off a little bit. There are some small details that aren't as good as they should be in the art but it's still a wonderful game."

Now by visually I mean the art style they went with is one that the Switch got no problem handling and is a massive step up from what Awakening and Fates had with them being on handheld. Animations are great with surprisingly few mistakes which is great to see. OST is.. it's Fire Emblem so of course it's fantastic.

- Combat is mostly like it's been in Fire Emblem and it's still as enjoyable as ever. Missions are overall the best out of Awakenings and Fates. Not every mission is mega memorable but they gradually got better and better as the story and narrative progressed.

- Characters are improved upon in comparison to the ones in Awakenings and Fates, By that I mean that the ones in 3H are in general more fleshed out, more reasonable and less reliant on ""unique"" character traits that replace any semblence of the character being an actual person. Still a few of those characters are there and that's fine, they are minority now and not the main portion"

But damn, this game is great. The battles are quite fast, and I actually spend most of my time roaming around, looking for objects and talking with NPCs. The back stories of some of these characters are very interesting too.

And for the people who just want a pure Tactical-RPG **** can skip most(like 90%) of the cutscenes. And really focus on the training and battles. But believe me, you really want to train your characters."

The addition of the training and social aspect of the academy is a welcome breath of fresh air. I find the school atmosphere vaguely (just vaguely) reminiscent of the Persona series, but the strategy and mechanics are definitely going to feel familiar and interesting to fans of the older games. The story is captivating, and I can feel myself conflicted during certain parts and empathizing with the characters I've met as well. Overall, I've found so far that this installment is more accessible to casual gamers and yet has more than enough to sink your teeth into for hardcore gamers.

  ",10,"FE3H is a fantastic game with some minor issues. The most glaring issues come in visuals with some slow down in areas of the monastery. The most significant is when you approach the online visitors section of the map. In addition to the slow down there, seeing students with different names ""visiting"" the monastery can be immersion breaking for some, so I suggest avoiding it since the payoffs are often not worth the effort anyway.

Voice acting and dialogues between characters are fantastic, for the most part. My only gripes are with repetition for a few and the direction for the character Petra. People that struggle with a foreign language do not speak the way she does. It is really immersion breaking and makes you want to ditch the character all together, which is a shame because her design is fantastic. Other than that, in my play through with the Blue Lions I thoroughly enjoyed just about every character—some more so the more I got to know them, such as Dedue.

The art in the game is great if you're into that type of anime style. The transitional artwork between chapters is my favorite so far. I love those sections each time I pass a major battle to finish a month.

As for gameplay, if you're new to Fire Emblem be aware that the higher difficulty will be quite tough to manage, so start at normal. If you're okay with losing characters, go ahead and skip casual mode. There are plenty of students to recruit and you always have the ability to rewind time if someone dies, so long as you use your tactics wisely. Maps are mostly good, though some can be a mess to get around. People will complain about the weapon triangle being gone, but the way the battles work it just doesn't matter. If anything, they're less predictable now, so I see that being where most of the complaints are coming from.

I understand the Persona comparisons, but aside from the art style FE3H's monastery feels more like Mass Effect 2 to me. Like ME, you're building relationships in one area that changes character positions after each major objective in the story. There are also support building paralogues with characters to complete, just like ME2 in the lead up to the finale. The major difference here is that instead of a space ship you're in a giant monastery and there are far less loading times.

For those of you looking to start this series, and you're into long playthroughs with a lot of depth and character building, then give this one a go. Think of FE more like a chess game with cool battles each time pieces move on the board. If you like that type of strategy, don't pass this one up.

If you're looking at the negative reviews on here stating that this game detracts from the older FE titles, don't bother with them. Games cannot remain the same, just as music or art do not. If they remain the same then they will become stale and a series will lose interest and die out. That's why the Awakening release was so popular. This is another natural change and a welcome one for the FE series."

When I realize the dead character would not come back again, I felt there was a burden in my shoulder, that is, I should be responsible for my peers’ life. Is it funny? I was so serious about a game. I remember this strong feeling which is the reason that I love fire emblem series. This can also explain the reason I love THREE HOUSES. I do not care about the weapon triangle, whether dead people can be alive or duration of weapons. What I really care about is a story making me want to be involved and the mechanics making me have strong feeling to those characters, just like the first time I played this series.

  ",10,"As someone who has played most western Fire Emblems, this one takes the cake for the most engrossing and moving story as well as having engaging tactical gameplay. Battles are varied in terms of settings, enemies, and map-strategies, and the paralogues provide a great deviation from the normal objectives. I am playing on hard/classic and I feel that it provides the perfect challenge without being overbearing. The school setting provides for a needed break between battles, allowing for character development and character progression. I didn't think I would love this aspect of the game, but wandering around the monastery doing various activities (and trying to recruit students) has been a blast. I couldn't recommend this game enough for fans of strategy games or JRPGS like Persona. My opinion, however, is completely subjective and what may be a 10/10 game for me may be a 6/10 for someone else. It's the perfect game for me, and i'd recommend giving it a shot for someone who has never played a fire emblem game before. P.S. the story is independent from other Fire Emblem games and you do not need to have played ANY of the other games to understand what is going on!"

In the year since till now, I have played almost every game in the series, barring the Tellius games and the 8-bit original. Now that the game is finally out, what are my thoughts on this game? Well having played only one route so far, I can safely say that this game is worth the wait. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is an unpolished masterpiece, however. The story and lore of the game is profoundly greater than the past few games and more reminiscent of the Judgral games which is a big plus in my book. For the most part, the characters were deep and quite lovable, having personal stories connecting to the overall narrative in some cases. Not to mention that the gameplay is both fun, rewarding, and addicting. My only main gripe of this game might have to be its rather unpolished feel. The game can feel a bit laggy at times. The environments range from good to ugly; some backgrounds look like they are from the Nintendo 64. Though this is the first ""HD"" Fire Emblem game, Intelligent Systems cannot be excused for leaving such graphical farts in the final release. Overall, despite the unpolished nature of the graphics, the story, gameplay, and characters take center stage. If you do not mind bad textures and are in the mood for a great RPG and tactical game, I highly recommend this game to you."

Graphics are not amazing and yet the best graphics of the franchise, battle gameplay is good.

exploration and supports are fun but also skippable You dont HAVE to spend an hour talking to everyone in the monastary each month especially on repeated playthroughs it just fleshes out the story more, large cast and freedom to assign their roles/recruit students from other houses as well as 4 story paths offer a lot of replayability.

new game + also helps bypass things you might find tedious your second or more playthrough

I am personally looking forward to the harder difficulties.

This game and franchise is not for everyone as it is 30 years old and has the mechanics of an older turn based game, something i prefer.

The graphics are not cutting edge, however they are not ""ps2 level"" and are the best the series has ever had, assuming you were able to play the previous games without hating their graphics i dont see the problem

The support conversations are not a majority waifu/husbando bait but if you don't like them you can just hit the start button and skip them with no penalty so i also don't see the issue here.

The characters have interesting designs and backstories and none of the three houses are purely good or evil, they all have their own circumstances and are various shades of gray."

I've been a Fire Emblem fan since FE7 released on the GBA and I've played at least 7 games so far, with this game easily in the top 3 alongside FE7 and Path of Radiance. The amount of love and care the developers put into this game is obvious, from the beautiful soundtrack, to the excellent writing, and stellar voice acting of the cast. I've played the game for about 25 hours so far and im totally hooked. Amazingly, I've also barely scratched the surface! The developers have added multiple branching paths to the story that genuinely pack a lot of unique content in. The replayability of this game is seriously mindboggling. So far my favorite parts of the game are the charming cast of characters. Knowing that I may soon be seeing some of my favorite characters on the opposite end of the battlefield with deadly results gives serious weight to the story and added great depth to the plot. My biggest gripes so far are the level design and the reuse of maps in side battles, though to be fair both of those issues are long standing problems in the series. Additionally the menus can be overwhelming at times and yet they often still lack some crucial information which leads to a lot of frustratimg flipping through menus. While certainly not perfect, this game is a huge step forward after the controversial Awakening and Fates, and it puts the series on strong footing.

The smartest choice this game made was putting the characters front-and-center.

  ",9,"So many games of this scale use NPCs as plot devices to put together a story. Others use annoyingly frequent cutscenes for character development. However, Fire Emblem Three Houses is the first game I've played where the NPCs are the main force driving the story forward. The characters are amazing, and character development happens through conversations. It reminds me of **** valley in that regard. Characters are deep and their emotions are genuine. The phenomenal VA makes this game absurdly immersive.

I have never been a big fan of turn based combat or strategy focused games, but the combat in this game is simple enough to be enjoyed by anyone, and complex enough to be enjoyed by hardcore fans. I actually care about the characters, making battles all the more serious. I want my characters to succeed and stay alive because I can actually care about them. No other game has succeeded in that goal.

The performance is solid, although the textured are low-quality. However it's hard to dwell on these low-res textures because the character models are so absolutely fantastic.

I love this game so much, and chances are you will too."

My only issue, and the only reason I didn't give it a 10, is the lack of inclusive romance options. In a cast with ~40 romance options (~20 each for male or female Byleth), they could only include a single **** male option? That's incredibly low-effort and Nintendo should be ashamed for such little effort put into it. Otherwise, that's the only annoyance I have"

  ",10,"Excellent game. Like-able characters, accessible game play. Don't listen to the negative user reviews, developers are allowed to iterate on their game designs and try new things. The whole school aspect is a more fresh approach to the series and lends it a level of depth that I find welcoming. It allows you to feel like you are getting to know these characters well, and then as the story progresses you feel very attached to what is going on.

The time rollback mechanic does mean the combat is much more forgiving than it has been in the past, but I would recommend this game as an introduction to the series to anyone. Well done Nintendo."

The game is a mix of chess, RPG elements and anime drama.
I'm enjoying everything so far, and even if i hate weeb culture i find the characters fun.
I'm playing in hard mode and the difficulty is literally perfect, even side missions are a challenge and you need to evaluate every move.
This is the only game since Botw that hooked me, once a start playing it's hard to stop, it gives you a ton of different things to do, resulting in an experience that will hardly bore the player.
Overall i'l give this a 9, for me a 10 is only for masterpieces and perfect games and this is not one, but i could change my mind once i finish it."

  ",10,"El mejor juego de la saga. Jugablemente tiene más posibilidades y profundidad que cualquier otro gracias a la gran personalización de las unidades que ofrece. Cada personaje es como un lienzo en blanco, una figura de barro que puedes moldear como quieras dándote así mucha libertad y rejugabilidad. Además toma como referencia Genealogy of the Holy War, lo cual es muy bueno. Los mapas están bien y la ayuda de Koei Tecmo se nota a la hora de representar batallas más realistas, con mayor sensación de guerra gracias a la presencia de los soldados menores. Quizá el juego es más fácil que otras entregas, pero se puede solucionar con una subida de dificultad.

El monasterio y su exploración son un gran añadido. Entretenido y complejo, que además puede amenizarse en caso de que no guste con la automatización de ciertas actividades. La referencia de Persona con el calendario y la interacción con los personajes se nota y se agradece. Es una buena forma de profundizar y empatizar con ellos.

La historia es muy interesante. Los personajes, aunque a priori parezcan genéricos y faltos de carisma, a medida que los vas conociendo también son interesantes. La banda sonora es una maravilla y los gráficos, aunque no perfectos, son una importante evolución respecto a las entregas de 3DS y Wii."

No matter if its the audio, visuals or just the baseline combat system, this game deserves more than that. Its a nicely polished game that weaves interesting characters, stories and combat we love.

The people who are complaining that the saga changed in 'Awakening' and degraded, are the people who don't understand that Fire Emblem only survived BECAUSE of awakening. That was the game that kept this franchise from being closed down by Nintendo. So of course they are going to continue with the same formula that kept the game success. I'm glad they did :). This is a fun game, it may not be perfect due to how much it throws at you especially if you are new (I feel they could do better with this) but definitely 7/10 or higher score is well deserved."

This is a strong contender for rpg of the year. Story is subjective and I'm not far enough in to state whether or not it's amazing but so far I'm really enjoying it, especially the characters.

This is my first Fire Emblem so it's my first taste of this style of combat and I really like it a lot. I've spent a lot of time doing additional battles to level up my characters mainly because it's so much fun.
There's also a lot to do around the monastery in the form of activities like fishing, studying, singing, eating, cooking or offering advice. This stuff is largely optional though so it can all be skipped quite easily. It does seem helpful as a means of boosting your team's motivation levels or giving them additional perks in battle.

Replayability seems to be one of the standout qualities of this game. I can easily see myself doing two or three playthroughs as there are different battles, characters, final bosses and endings.

My only criticism is that the beginning is quite slow and it'll take a while before you get to fight anyone but it's still been enjoyable throughout.
Some people here seem to criticize it for borrowing ideas from Persona 5 but is that a bad thing? It's not like Persona is an annual franchise. There was an 8 year gap between persona 4 and 5... might be a while before we play another one so if other games want to take inspiration from it then they can go right ahead."

Allocating extra skill points for example could be done between missions in other entries. Now you have to run around for half an hour, grabbing gifts from one student, bring them to others, then get vegetables as reward, which you use at the dinner activity to bring their motivation up, so you can use the motivation to lecture them personally and raise their skill points. Its just useless.

And combat is the easiest its ever been. There are so many crutches that you literally cannot do wrong. Not only can you turn back time, but also the game shows you exactly where and who enemies will target. Meaning that you literally cannot make a wrong move. There's no strategy involved and combat just revolves around exploiting this."

Personally I think Awakening’s story wasn’t that good either. I’m short I like the story as far as I have played (about 15 hours in Chapter 8). The characters are well written and have a lot of depth. Graphics could be better but they’re totally okay. School system is a great innovation  and fits perfectly to Fire Emblem.

  ",10,"Amazing game. I've been waiting to see what this game could offer, especially on the nintendo switch and I have to say that it did not disappoint me at all. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I used to listen to FE Echoe's ost religiously but boy was I not ready for TH's soundtrack. The writing seems to be alot better than fate's and I definitely enjoyed TH a lot more than awakening and echoes. Of course there's alot that can be improved on but for me, this is easily my top fire emblem game so far. Personally, I really enjoyed this game and I hope others will too. My favourite switch game so far.

For those who didn't like the new changes to fire emblem/want to go back to the tellius series, you have to agree that awakening made the series more popular than it already was. Awakening wasn't the best fire emblem I played too, but I didn't mind trying the new features and gave it a go instead of whinging. Plus if you viewed it less as some weeaboo waifu bs and more as  Support dialogues (which past games had too) it wouldn't be too bad. Having houses/school life/magic =/= harry potter btw"

  ",9,"As always, straight to the scores:

Graphics quality: 9/10. Almost every game that releases is capable of looking better, and FE3H is no exception. However, whether it is the animated cutscenes, traversing the monastery, or engaging in large-scale tactical battles, FE3H looks beautiful. I genuinely believe this is one of the reasons the game pulled me in so quickly, and I am so happy to see that time was taken to ensure the game looks as good as it does.

Animation: 9/10. Again, same thing. Beautiful. I was very happy to see things that were not previously animated, being animated. The best way I can describe this is that there are smaller things you will notice from time to time that you never thought would make a difference - like the fact that there is no longer an animation for ""entering"" an attack. Those things make a difference. All of the difference.

Story: 9/10. ""Harry Potter"" is not an accurate description of this game's story, because the only thing FE3H shares with Harry Potter is a House system. House systems are a tradition of England's schooling dating back hundreds of years. If anything, FE3H is historically accurate. And I am really disappointed that some of my fellow Fire Emblem veterans have simply dismissed the game for this reason, because the nuance of the story is something I really appreciate as opposed to many of FE's former titles. I won't tell you what to do, but in short, I do not believe you can actually ""play"" the game and walk away thinking it is like Harry Potter, so if I were you, I would strongly disregard anyone who brings that view to the table.

Characters: 10/10. Characters in this game are excellent. Dialog is snappy, and time spent with students really draws you into the world and its story. If you do not spend time with these characters, you will be missing a HUGE part of the game. Take the time to individually ""instruct"" them when the time comes and you will see that you care a lot about your students and their progress. You will definitely be invested in them and their lives.

Customization: 10/10. Your students progress is the foundation for FE3H customization options. Every single student has the ability to become so many different classes. It is your responsibility to see to it that they achieve their goals, true. But it is also your responsibility to ensure they try new things. If you do, you will find that some characters have a knack for classes they had no interest in - just like real life. This is a really fun part of the game that I think a lot of people are overlooking, so take your time with it.

Gameplay: 10/10. Honestly, FE3H feels as great as FE always has. They brought back weapon durability, which adds some busy work, in my opinion, but the classic battle system is there with just a few more layers to keep veterans interested. And its great! I also think the battle-to-schooling ratio is perfect, making battles feel more intense and more important then previous titles.

Voice-acting quality: 10/10. This entire game is voice acted. This ENTIRE game. I love the voices involved and I am really happy with all of the casting choices. I recognize many of the names, but generally the voices are a ""good fit"" for the characters you are speaking with.

Music: 8/10. The music is well implemented. There some interesting decisions with sound design in the battles that I think I just need to play more to understand, but it seems like the music shifts depending on what is occurring, which is cool. None of the tracks stand out to me so far though, which is a shame. ""You are the ocean's gray waves"" comes into my mind every so often, and I miss that.

Price of game: 10/10. No MTX BS, no content cut before launch just to sell as DLC. Just a really great game for $60.

Extrinsic positive/negatives: +0/-1 points for auto advance/auto-scroll during conversations not being as tight as it should be. This may seem like a minor nitpick to some, but when the story and the characters are this good, I just want to enjoy them like a movie, not continuously click after their lines are delivered.

Average score: 9.3/10. I got the game a day early and said, ""oh wth, I will just play an hour or two."" I had planned to play considerably the next day, but since it came a day early, why not, right? Well, I ended up playing for five or six hours and I did not realize it. Because I was just having fun. Having said that, I am only about eight hours in now, so I will be returning to update this review as I play through the rest of the game.

I hope this review helps you make an informed decision!"
