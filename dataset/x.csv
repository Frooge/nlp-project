  ",9,"A great Pokemon title and an incredibly nostalgic game that I watched countless hours of and collected all the cards from before actually getting my hands on it myself. The visuals are great and hold up nicely, making for a smooth transition from 2D to 3D graphics and legitimately looking much better than the recent Switch titles. The new Pokemon are all great with fun moves and abilities, and the addition of the Fairy type was genius. The addition of Mega Evolution is even better, making for insanely cool Pokemon alterations and animations. The exploration is decent with some fun puzzles, although I was never a fan of how TMs functioned in the overworld. The gyms are aesthetically pleasing and mostly clever as well. The majority of this game is too easy for sure until the late and post-game, making for some fun challenges. The supporting characters are all great and fit nicely within an interesting narrative with amazing lore. Anyone offset by cheesy writing or moments should play the campaign through since the post-game missions are phenomenal in every aspect. Fast travel allows for easier completion and exploring the city of Lumiose is genuinely immersive, even making for some cinematic moments. I look forward to my future with what is so far my personal favorite Pokemon title."

Es una generación con buenos diseños, historia entretenida y, en líneas generales, me pareció tener mucho emcanto. Artísticamente y técnicamente es muy bueno. Si nunca lo jugaste recomiendo darle una oportunidad para conocer su mundo y lore."

  ",10,"The main series of Pokemon games have never suffered from not being re-playable.  It is part of why Pokemon games have a higher resale value than some others.  The truly dedicated players out there keep every copy of Pokemon that they have obtained, which makes for slim pickings in the pre-owned Pokemon inventory of some stores.  Perhaps the two biggest selling points of Pokemon X & Y are the over 60 new Kalos region Pokemon and the mega evolutions.  The increased size of the Pokedex appeals to the collectors while the mega evolutions appeal to the competitive players.  All in all, these games are worthy of a Pokemon player's attention."

The difficulty of this one it's kind of a theme in the Pokémon community with most of them claiming that it's way too easy but i think that's not a bad thing. As i said before the game it's perfect to make new people interested in the franchise. The 3D makes the game look great, Kalos it's a beautiful region and probably has the best map of all principal games. The looks of the towns with the atmosphere it's also beautiful, the 69 new Pokémon doesn't look as bad as the Unova's ones, of course there's some that are just bad like Barbaracle but in every Pokémon game there's at least three or four designs that ****.

  ",3,"The only reason I am giving it a rating as high as 3 is because this gave Game Freak some experience towards making better 3d games. These games in everything were bad. They were way too easy, I do not remember the post game at all, They give yo a billion starters and worst of all, you do not even fight a Mega Evolution until Lysandre... LYSANDRE!!! The Elite Four also do not have any Megas and ya don't fight one until the champion!?!? The new gimmick was completely overshadowed, even though it was a solid gimmick. It also was a shame because they did not put Mega Evolutions in the story. Imagine a game where scientists try to evolve Pokemon even further than Mega Evolution, and you have to stop them and at the end, fight an even more difficult boss (Probably Charizard because it is Game Freak's favorite child). I know it would have taken a lot more time to make, but instead of ORAS, they could have given us this. But the Pokemon were very cool. Trust me, it took me very long to not give this game a 5, just because it had Mega Gengar."

  ",9,"Pokemon XY + ORAS allowed you to complete the entire Gen 6 National Pokedex, all the way up to 721 (after mythical events). The competitive scenes were absolutely revolutionary for their time. Gen 6 featured a bigger Smogon than ever and the two most recognizable VGC tours to this date. The Vs. Recorder was a sandbox that allowed you to create matches against AIs in any way you wanted. This worked especially if you had 2 consoles with 2 compatible games. Gen 6 had the best online system to this date with the PSS having extremely convenient interface. Gen 6 introduced 3D models and advanced interaction with your Pokemon, allowing you to connect with them more. The 3DS games had some of the deepest lore in the series to talk about with other people. Super Secret Bases in ORAS ensured the Hoenn region was kept alive with something new and refreshing potentially coming every day. The introduction of megas were amazing and they gave the series so much life. This mechanic aimed to focus more on connecting the player to the Pokemon they have, unlike Dynamax and Terastallization. Gen 6 also expanded on shinies to make them more feasible to obtain, which gave rise to a dedicated shiny hunting community. Gen 6 was a time where the entire Pokemon community was at its most united since Gen 1, all because it mastered the fundamentals of what made Pokemon stand out while also leaving a lot to play with and discuss. You could really catch them all and aim to be the very best, like no one ever was.

I'm putting this up just for X in case I want to use Y to elaborate on my thoughts on XY specifically. atm I just wanted to give this game a score. I didn't give this game a 10, because in most aspects, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire outclass them and these games lack extra content in comparison to your typical upper version or remake games prior to Gen 8. They're still quite useful for collecting Pokemon in a way no other Pokemon game as of current can achieve and alongside Sun and Moon, are the best Pokemon games to introduce a generation."

Now, the best point of this game is the gameplay, the gyms, the battles, the scenarios and the main villain are incredible. is to accompany and face.

Pokémon X marks the beginning of Pokémon's 3D era, and the game takes advantage of that with more cinematic shots, the introduction of character customization and a feature that after almost 20 years of franchise finally allows players to pet and feed their Pokémon, leading to the most immersive Pokémon experience yet. Ironically enough, X is also the least interesting Pokémon adventure since Red and Blue, with a storyline full of the same plotpoints that the series has been recycling since the third generation, lacking the character depth of the fifth generation or the mythological depth of the other ones. Kalos lacks the defined identity of the previous regions, being thematically less focused, and yet the journey through it remains decently enjoyable to its grandiose cities and enchating towns immersed in a naturally and artistically luxurious aura emphasized by its orchestral, regal musical pieces. Megaevolutions attempt at revitalizing the repetitive core gameplay formula, but the novelty of it quickly wores off since only a handful of Pokémon can benefit from it, but especially because the game is so insultingly easy that you'll never really need to Megaevolve any of your Pokémon, leaving the repetitive formula of the series devoid of the challenge that made it worthwhile. Level Design, although visually creative, is significantly less deep than the previous games, with an extremely streamlined map structure that rarely gives any meaningful explorative freedom. All of this is aggravated by a meager postgame content that doesn't offer anything significant."

  ",0,"Pokémon X and Y were when the series jumped the shark (or the Sharpedo, to remain in-theme).
-Started gen 1 pandering (starters and most mega evos being from Kanto)
-Removed some of BW/BW2 ideas and QoL improvements.
-Linear with low difficult level
-Poor postgame
-Bad story and characters. BW's mature themes are still here, but it generally feels two step backwards compared to gen 5.
-Very incomplete, both in content and story. It still makes me angry that despite the mysteries and hints we never got an XY sequel, with GF making **** ORAS and skipping straight to gen 7.
I hate it so much I even deleted my 6 year old save data with over 400 hours in it to avoid bad memories."

If there's one thing I can say is really good about this game, it's the region. Some will say it's kind of a **** but I for one really like the seasonal progression of the game. It allows for some fantastic and extremely memorable routes. Additionally, Mega Evolution is a fun mechanic, and it was great seeing some of my favorites that weren't really strong, like Mawile and Houndoom, turn into absolute powerhouses.
But that's about all the praise I can give these games. Sure, the Pokemon formula still works here, but there's just not much. There's basically nothing to do once you complete the main story. No new areas to explore, no Battle Frontier, nothing. Just the Friend Safari and the Battle Tower and that's pretty much it. Additionally, once you get through the around the third or fourth Gym, the pacing in the game decides to crank up to a breakneck pace. It's a bit disappointing, since I felt the pacing before than was fairly good. There was a lot to see and explore, but once you get back to Lumiose it's a mad dash to the finish line.
As stated before, it's a very bare-bones Pokemon experience, which isn't necessarily ""bad."" I just feel like these games, the only pair in the series thus far to NOT get a third version, are the ones that would have benefited most from one."

  ",8,"Pokemon X is quite the innovative piece of art. The overarching theme of the game, being a lush Paris lifestyle with lots of gardens and villages, follows you throughout the entire game, while still keeping slight contrast. Game Freak had a lot on their plate trying to nudge Pokemon towards the world of 3D, and they did a great job of keeping it tame.

Changing up the art style and dimensions of an already successful franchise is tough business, but Game Freak knew what kind of work they had cut out for them. Music carried the heart and soul of Pokemon through the entire game, reminding you that when you enter a new city, or your Pokemon is sent out to battle, that this is still the Pokemon adventure you set off on long ago. The Mega Evolution idea was very interesting, and added a cool new power to play around with about half way through the game. It immediately made sense as part of the Pokemon world, even if you don't quite understand it at first.

The story of the game follows suit with the rest of Pokemon games. It's not awfully original, but the developers clearly tried to draw a line in the story to make it stand out from the rest. In all honesty, it didn't feel like a whole new world, just a new region to explore and conquer, which I loved, though I'm not sure how new Pokemon players feel about the lack of hand holding.

Pokemon designs are fresh, the region and story stand out from the crowd, and there are several new features to get accustomed with and enjoy. There isn't much wrong with this game at all other that it's seemingly careful approach to not diverge from the typical ideas of the Pokemon series. Even then though, they pulled it off well and made sure it didn't fall into forgetfulness. Being not an awfully hard game, it's worth the pickup for anybody with a 3DS looking for a new adventure to dive into."

Positives
Mega evolution turned out to be super cool
Most of the new Pokémon designs are pretty great
Siebold is one of the bois
Region can be pretty to look at sometimes (although I think that the graphics have aged badly in this game in comparison to the 2d pixel art era)

Negatives
Weak, weak, weak, weak storyline
Awful “rivals”
Team flare is so boring, they are just worse team galactic with flame style outfits
Malva was a good character idea, but was utilized in pretty much the worst way that she possibly could
Too easy

It was the beginning of the future for Pokemon with 3D models making it`s first apperance and also Mega evolutions being introduced to the series. with over 700 models having to be made, and also adding animations for the new megas. This made the game lack in other areas, we didn`t get many new pokemon and the story was a bit meh. But even when it`s lacking in certain areas it`s still a very enjoyable game, I`ve played this game several times and I enjoy it every time. Many of the new pokemon designs were very good. The game likes to hold your hand a lot through the story which is a bit annoying, but still doesn`t take a lot out of my enjoyment of the games. A lot of fun features was added to the game, like chain fishing, and also brought back the pokeradar. If you`re just getting into pokemon, or haven`t played it for a few titles i would really recommend starting up with these titles."

Thanks to the simultaneous multi-region release date more players than ever before will be able to experience first-hand that indescribable sensation of unearthing brand new Pokémon that have nimbly avoided the dreaded internet leaks.

A wonderful blend of excitement and nostalgia, Pokémon X and Y evolves the core series with its impressive polygonal 3D environments and magical camera angle mastery, adding a few technical adjustments along with a brand new Pokémon type to the original formula that we all know and love. It's not quite a revolution — and is hindered slightly by the meagre use of its host platform's glasses-free 3D capabilities — Pokémon X and Y is sure to steal the hearts of Pokémon fans new and old alike."

Not much else to say about that point. The music is also subpar compared to previous and later entries in the series.  The story is boring and a tad nonsensical. This game just doesn't properly capture what i believe is the personality and character of the Pokemon franchise.  This game does have some strong points.  The new Pokemon in this generation are probably the second most all-around great group of monsters to-date, only to be edged out in terms of consistently good designs later by Sun and Moon.  The human character designs are really good as well.  This game does make for a decent starting off point for newcomers, but it may make them think all of the games in the franchise are this easy.  The game looks nice considering the hardware its running on.  Not a bad game, but definitely less than what I would expect from the Pokemon franchise."

  ",2,"This is by far the worst mainline Pokemon game on 3DS and possibly the entire series. The graphics are lame, childish, and all the towns are too small to really appropriate. Kalos is by far the most forgettable region. If it wasn't for the anime, I would have forgotten about this place as soon as ORAS came out. Mega Evolution are just a gimmick, and the devs were heavily bias towards Gen 1 in terms of giving Pokemon Megas. Mega Evolution broke the game, and the devs knew this so they banned all megas for SM online and made them post-game exclusive. The story was god-awful, with the worst evil team so far. (Team Flare) They might be even worse than Team Galactic, and they were terrible! Along with tons of plot-holes, too many rivals with little or no personality,  and a villain with inconsistent goals, this plot blows. Along with that, this has got to be one of the easiest games of all time, nearing baby game levels. All the gym leaders, yes even the 7th and 8th, have a limit of 3 Pokemon and 3 moves on each. Along with that, the game gives you not one, but TWO starters, one which can mega evolve. Along with that you get a free OP perfect IV Lucario very early into the game which can mega evolve right from the get-go. That Lucario can easily solo the entire game by itself, making the game a cakewalk. Only four trainers in the entire game use megas, the 3rd gym leader during the mega evolution tutorial fight, the evil team leader during his last fight, and the champion. The only other one is your rival, who you can fight once per day. This makes the game even easier, as you have a major advantage most other characters don't have. Even the elite four, supported to be the strongest in the game, only have 4 Pokemon with 3 moves each and no megas. The also don't get stronger after you enter the hall of fame. WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY!!! Another thing to note is that there is literally no postgame. You just go to a new town, fight your rival, and then meet the professor who allows you to find the rest of the mega stones you didn't obtain as part of the story. That's it. Oh right, there is a battle facility called the battle mason that is literally another clone of the worst battle facility from Emerald: the battle tower. Wasn't the battle subway and the world tower enough? It's just an endless grind against cheating NPCs for competitive items. It's awful. No matter how bad the game gets, no one can forget the hype leading up to this game. This game single-handedly saved the 3DS. I remember for my 10th birthday I asked for a DSi XL instead of a 3DS because the 3DS didn't have a Pokemon game yet. I only bought the 3DS once XY came out the following year. I know many other people had a similar experience, and I can thank XY for giving us so many great games like Yokai Watch and Radiant Historia. But that doesn't excuse the awful level design, story, gameplay, and graphics that permeate throughout this awful game. 2/10"

Was it fun?

I really enjoy playing this game, I have competitively competed in Pokemon and it all started with this game. I love IV breeding, EV training, egg move breeding. If you have any questions about Pokemon and competitive play, I’m a good one to ask.

Are there any similar games?

Other Pokemon games?

Favorite Character/Unit to use?

My favorite Pokemon in this game is Dragonite but in the main story Talonflame was my go-to guy. Brave Bird, bro.

Would you play it again?

There is a chance, I could get back into Pokemon.

Any Complaints?

I hate that the competitive aspect of the game has an element of luck. Its frustrating because I’m not the luckiest person you’ll ever meet.

  ",2,"There are 5 main reasons why I gave this game this score. First and foremost: the region, the region is the most unoriginal, uninteresting, boring region the Pokemon franchise has ever seen. It doesn't even have a legendary trio such as the timeless classics suicune, entei and raikou. Its a bland carbon copy of France but you might say that Black and White is also a carbon copy of Manhattan. My answer: No it isn't. does Manhattan have a desert? and does Unova have a stupidly renamed empire state building cough...lumiose tower...cough. does Manhattan have mountains or a big lake in the middle? Does castelia city have a central park copy? Does Unova have American cliches? The answer to all of these questions is obviously NO. Kalos is simply a lazy copy of France. topped with the sorry excuse of a city that looks exactly the same throughout.
Second reason is the pathetic story. A stupid looking man that wants to destroy the world.... WOW!  And 5 pathetic generic friends that have no personality and no relation to the already pathetic story and have no strong or interesting bonds with you paired with the ""different"" team flare generasl that are full of personality. I cant believe how Gamefreak did it! Oh and how did team flare get xerneas? beats me.
Third reason is the camera angles. When I hear about a 3D pokemon game I think about a wide camera angle that constantly revolves around the battlefield not a static 2D image that shows a small part of my pokemon ie. mega venusaur or a brief narrow camera angle that revolves around the battlefield.
Fourth reason is the music. The music is terrible throughout the game, ESPECIALLY team flares theme. Its the most annoying, repetitive, boring theme I have ever heard in my entire life let alone in the pokemon franchise. The rest of the music is bland and forgettable ie. gym theme.
Fifth and final reason is the mega evolutions. Gamefreak obviously tried to sugar coat this game by giving popular pokemon mega evolutions. This destroyed the chance for cool but under powered pokemon to rise into fame. And mega garchomp is so different from its original design its feels like  different pokemon
Also there are very little hair styles for the male characters and most of the clothes look really stupid. They should have made type specific clothing sets like a psychic trainer set and a fire trainer set etc.
Never would I have imagined that the pokemon franchise would take a steep dive in quality. This game is a sorry excuse for a pokemon game and a disgrace to the pokemon franchise."

You have to understand that this kind of gameplay was acceptable back in the 80s and early 90s on the NES and SNES consoles, but gaming has advanced a lot since then. On Gameboy the 1st  generation was a success mostly because of the fun concept of monster catching and the anime, as a game even back then it was nothing special, little more than a fad.

That after 20 years, Nintendo has kept remaking the same archaic concept with minor additions and just upgrading the graphics, and the gullible masses keep buying this stuff, is buffling to me. Hugely overrated, and if you are older than 12 and still play Pokemon, something is wrong with you. I can play cute games just fine, it is not the presentation that is the issue, it is the gameplay.

  ",10,"Poke'mon X gives the Poke'mon series the shot in the arm it needed. As a lapsed fan it certainly succeeded in pulling me back in. Perhaps part of that is due to the familiar faces from Generation 1 that I had grown up with. Does that make me nostalgic? Perhaps. Does it make me a genwunner? Not really as I found some new favorites too. The most immediate impression you will have with Poke'mon X/Y is that it significantly overhauls the visuals. Battles are now rendered in full 3D and are a joy to behold.

The Poke'mon series hasn't evolved dramatically over the years but it has added new mechanics over time that all come into play in Poke'mon X. Prior games introduced things like dual types, natures, IV's and EV's, breeding, team battles, etc. It even allows you to fully customize a male or female character for the first time. Poke'mon X and Y introduces Mega Evolution that can change your poke'mon's type among other things mid-battle which adds another layer of complexity.

Pokemon X/Y also has a robust online with additions like Wonder Trading. The slot machine like nature of wonder trade is a gamble but it can certainly pay off if people offer more than just another diglet, vulpix, or other common poke'mon.

The story which is simple but serviceable will last you about 40 hours give or take. But I was surprised to find that playing a half hour here, a hour there, all total I had put over 600 hours into Poke'mon X. Collecting, trading, evolving and battling are as addictive as ever. The meta game in Poke'mon offers plenty of value alone. Building a team and raising their stats through super training or even just trying to collect all 700+ poke'mon. Poke'mon X and its counterpart Y are perhaps the best main entries in the series to date."

Me gustan los juegos de pokemon y por eso lo compre, y en cuanto lo empece a jugar me sorprendio, no esperaba mas que otro juego de la serie y quede encantado, es mi favorito sin duda, la historia dentro del juego va mas alla de ser un entrenador pokemon, senti un cambio muy grande, la historia me atrapo y por prmera vez en un juego de pokemon queria avanzar en el juego para saber de su historia y desenlace mas que por vencer a la liga y empezar con los combates en linea. Es cierto, la historia no es innovadora ni muy profunda, pero le da un toque muy especial al juego. La musica es agradable, los controles comodos y graficamente es bueno. No me gusto mucho la generacion de pokemones de esta entrega, los encuentro feos, pero lo demas esta bastante bien"

The graphics are good, the Wonder Trade system is fun, the Pokemon-Amie system is a good way to really feel like you are building a connection with your Pokemon, and the story was fairly intriguing. My only main problem was that I often found following the maps and traveling very confusing, but that might have been my own problem rather than the games problem. Overall, really good!"

  ",6,"For some reason, I think Pokemon X and Y didn't success much as the other games. But I'd love to give it a point for it's splendid graphics, and cutscenes. Also, the new ""Mega Evolution"" feature, really got it going. It was probably the ""Mega Evolution"" that hyped kids who played the game the most, so they didn't care much about the actual story, and the easiness of the game. For most kids, they don't want to ""catch em' all"" they just want to be the most powerful player. So yeah, most kids who played the game really loved the ""Mega Evolution"". But now let's think again. For the actual gamers, the game had the usual ""cliche Pokemon game plot"", which is the plot where an evil team wants to take over the world using powerful Pokemon. A lot of gamers disliked it. THEY wanted a different plot. Also, the game was TERRIBLY easy for the experienced players. It just lowered the game's pizzazz, and it was boring. It was so boring that the new Pokemon aren't even exciting anymore.

So I definitely recommend this game for the new Pokemon players, but if you are one of the more experienced Pokemon players, you probably shouldn't play this game."

  ",8,"Pokemon X is a major milestone in franchise history. With stunning graphics and gameplay much more dynamic and fluid, as fervent fan of Pokemon, I can say that this game is a dream come true, because from the generation of Game Boy Color, I dreamed of playing Pokemon with these graphics. It took, but it happened. Finally we can distinguish the faces of the characters and the people in the cities, and we can interact with our Pokemons realistically through the Pokemon Amie. Never complete the Pokedex been easier now that we have Wonder Trade. WT alone already guarantees many hours of fun for the player, since it can receive both a lvl 1 Zigzagoon as a legendary shiny lvl 100. And never hunt Shinys was so fun and assessível as now. The only negative aspect of this game is that it is extremely easy for veterans and hardened fans. The gym leaders are a joke so weak, including the Elite 4. None of them has a full staff, which makes it even easier for the player. The game also sounds incomplete in its history, since the third game of each generation (in this case, the future ""Pokemon Z"") is always the game what gets the ""best finish""."

  ",10,"Poke'mon X gives the Poke'mon series the shot in the arm it needed. As a lapsed fan it certainly succeeded in pulling me back in. Perhaps part of that is due to the familiar faces from Generation 1 that I had grown up with. Does that make me nostalgic? Perhaps. Does it make me a genwunner? Not really as I found some new favorites too. The most immediate impression you will have with Poke'mon X/Y is that it significantly overhauls the visuals. Battles are now rendered in full 3D and are a joy to behold.

The Poke'mon series hasn't evolved dramatically over the years but it has added new mechanics over time that all come into play in Poke'mon X. Prior games introduced things like dual types, natures, IV's and EV's, breeding, team battles, etc. It even allows you to fully customize a male or female character for the first time. Poke'mon X and Y introduces Mega Evolution that can change your poke'mon's type among other things mid-battle which adds another layer of complexity.

Pokemon X/Y also has a robust online with additions like Wonder Trading. The slot machine like nature of wonder trade is a gamble but it can certainly pay off if people offer more than just another diglet, vulpix, or other common poke'mon.

The story which is simple but serviceable will last you about 40 hours give or take. But I was surprised to find that playing a half hour here, a hour there,  all total I had put over 600 hours into Poke'mon X. Collecting, trading, evolving and battling are as addictive as ever. The meta game in Poke'mon offers plenty of value alone. Building a team and raising their stats through super training or even just trying to collect all 700+ poke'mon. Poke'mon X and its counterpart Y are perhaps the best main entries in the series to date."

As for the depth in the plot, I would say it is as deep as the plot from DPPT. It's not as dramatic as ORAS/RSE or BW/2, but it's not as simple as RGB/FRLG. With a game like this, you'll care more about your team rather than the storyline you're overcoming.

You'll spend maybe 20 hours on the game if you want to rush through everything, but if you want to raise your friendship with your pokemon, perfect your team's movesets, and explore the many other features in this game, you'll spend about 50+ or even more.

The history is ""meh"" but i understand this can be secondary in a pokemon game and obe of the worst thing in the game are the NPC dialogs that are childish and in the greater number boring.
Cities desing are cool and also buildings, in general artist aspect looks kind. I think the game is a little bit easier than older pokemon'games and it requires less time of farming time but you will not get bored beacuse of difficulty.

  ",8,"I'm still uncertain whether or not this is the best Pokemon release since Gold/Silver/Crystal. Though I'm not sure of that particular case, I'm sure this title follows everything Pokemon has been doing right since release. Of course we all know what happens here, a new map, you start with some Pokemon you got from the local professor, start fighting your way through the map stopping by cities to earn the badge from the gym leaders; eight of them are to be found.

When you finally have all badge you head for the Pokemon League and climb your way past the elite four to challenge the champion, if you win you're the new Pokemon Master and happy ending. Sure that's the formula, but doesn't it work still? With the incredibly deep meta-game surrounding all of it it's hard not to fall in love all over again with Pokemon, even if the formula of success has had decreased effectiveness over the years.

The internet now plays a big part in becoming the ultimate Pokemon collector. Unfortunately—as always—you can't capture every Pokemon in-game, requiring not only trades with Pokemon Y players, but also players with other versions like the remake of third generations and physical Pokemon conventions. yes, physical, in the era of easy internet and online event implemented in-game some Pokemon are only acquirable if you visit events taken place in few parts of the world. We all know where they are.

Maybe someday we'll get a game where you could at least catch most Pokemon by merely playing your game, until that day comes, let's just hope they increase the rate of online events. Right now I just hope they do any online event. I wouldn't even mind a Caterpie, it's a rare appearance these days. Times are changing, but not so much I'm afraid."

  ",2,"I love Pokémon and I always will but this game was not worth the money. I stayed up until midnight to download this game and I expected a great game filled with 3D graphics, a good story, great characters, and good Pokémon, but I was sadly wrong. First lets take a look at the Pokémon. The average number of Pokémon released in each game is 130 and with the previous games, Pokémon Black and White, introducing a whopping 156 Pokémon, these games must have just as many right? Nope, Pokémon X and Y have 69. How many of these are ""good""? Maybe 20. People complain about Pokémon Black and White having an ice-cream Pokémon and a garbage Pokémon but their designs are cool enough with the trash Pokémon becoming a giant trash monster and the ice cream one having a cool double head cone with two faces but nobody complains about the new cotton candy Pokémon? He's literally a floating piece of cotton candy with a face but unlike the previously mentioned Pokémon this one doesn't evolve into anything cool. Instead we get a fat walking cotton candy. Come on. Also many of the Pokémon are bland and are basically carbon copies of other ones. Next, lets talk about the world. The colors are dull and the region is very straightforward and is very long and boring (cough...parfum palace...cough) and there are huge gaps in between important events. The graphics may be 3D but the world is very, very, dull. The cities are also not memorable and are just a waste of time. My next point is the characters. Oh how I hate to talk about them. We have a generic professor, Trevor and Tierno, two lifeless boring characters, and your rival Serena or Calem. Serena and Calem are definitely two of the most boring characters ever to be in a video game. They are both very bland and have nothing about them and appear at random times. Next is the story. It ****. Basically some random guy who acts like he isn't evil but obviously is wants to create an invention to make a more beautiful world. Think about that. All of his team looks cool but the honestly do nothing. Also the champion is a character who you meat a couple times who has no personality and by the time you find out she's the champion, you really don't care. Also in Pokémon Black and White, at the end of the game right when you're surrounded by a group of bad guy all the gym leaders heroically come all the way over to you just to help. In Pokémon X most of the gym leaders don't leave the gym. Also with the game is obviously directed at people who started on the first Pokémon games or people who just started playing them. If you're like me or 60% of all Pokémon fans you aren't one of them. A new feature is that some Pokémon get a special Mega Evolution which is a huge power boost, but instead of giving them to the weak Pokémon, they give them to overpowered or fan favorite Pokémon. I mean does charizard or mewtwo really need TWO mega evolutions? Come on now! Also, the music is HORRIBLE. The previous games had catchy tunes you'll love listening too, especially Pokémon Platinum, but this music will make you either turn off sound or fall asleep, not like a lullaby like Nacrene City music, but like so boring you'd rather go to sleep than listen to it. Next up is the aftergame. After you beat the main story, which is very easy with the EXP share, you unlock a new town with a few little feature. This town has the friend safari, which is just another gimmicky grass patch and the horrendously boring Battle Maison which is just a bunch of boring battles. But wait! There's more! In Lumiose City, the gigantic city that is impossible to navigate, an old character named Looker informs you to help you out on a series of spy missions! Soundd fun, right! Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed it! It was nice and fun but there was one problem. It was too short. After that there's nothing important to do. Wow. Overall I love the Pokémon series but this was an abomination **** and I was definitely disappointed."

However, the game is way too short in comparison to the previous generations and, while there is a lot more to do outside of the main story, it falls short in my opinion as far as the amount of content in the game. My other complaint with this generation is some of the Pokemon they came up with, such as the keyring with keys and the ice cream cone. Previous generations were awesome and I feel as though this time around, they got lazy and could have come up with plenty of really creative and cool looking creatures. Overall, I think this is my least favorite generation in the Pokemon series and although the graphics update is very nice, I think it fell short in too many core concepts that the series is known for. I feel as though the upcoming ruby and sapphire versions will be an example of how this game should have been made with a longer story, better Pokemon, and a quality experience like the previous installments."

  ",6,"Note: This is a completely Honest review of someone who has played EVERY Main Series Pokemon Games.
And this is my personal opinion, so if you dislike it, cool, make your own review :3

Seven Words: OVERRATED, OVERHYPED, AND LACKS IN MOSTLY THINGS. ;)

Well Now, I'll explain myself, the game lacks and dissapoints in: the soundtrack because they did a dissapointing job compared to the other games in the series, unlike in HG/SS and W2/B2, which had a FANTASTIC soundtrack, then we've got the story, and maaan did it ****, Writing? Bad (Cheesy and unnatural dialogue), Characters? Forgetable (The only one's name I remember is Serena, but that's cause she's in the anime, duhh), Story as a whole? Well... nothing new AND pretty short (Like 10 hrs long), theeen we've got the graphics, they look nice, but the 3d **** since when it's activated on battles, the game lags :(
Then the Difficulty... I havent lost ONCE! and that's thanks to the dammed new Exp. Share mechanic (Which I'll rant to and explain later on this review)

Then the New stuff:
First we've got the added pokemon: I like 'em all, but like I  said, the game lacks in mostly everyway, specially in the added pokemon... ONLY 70 (Actually 72 but that's adding the other 2 pokemon of the trio that Diancie is a part of ;3) BUT the game complements that by increasing the amount ofcapturable pokemon from other regions to INSANE! (the Highest in the series actually)
Second, The Mega Evolutions............. Fanservice, by that I mean, MAKING ALREADY INCREDIBLY FAMOUS AND POWERFUL POKEMON AND LEGENDARY POKEMON (like Blaziken and Mewtwo) MORE POWERFUL IS A BAD IDEA, but making Pokemon which dont evolve more powerful by giving them a mega evolution is a GREAT idea in my opinion, and I want more of that, but that doesnt mean that I dont want a Samurott or Shaymin Mega Evolution *wink* *wink*
List of Mega Evolution I aproooove (bcuz i like em as pokemon): Absol, Mawile, Audino (OR/AS), Slowbro (OR/AS), Sableye (OR/AS), Diancie (OR/AS, because it ****), Steelix (OR/AS), Lopunny (OR/AS) and.... 4 of the Starters that now have mega evolution, which are, Venasaur, Blastoise, Swampert (OR/AS) AND Sceptile (OR/AS).

Now the movement and stuff you can do in the game... well I like the rollerskates but they make the bicycle completely worthless if only for IV and EV training, then we've got the stuff you can do... well multiplayer and the looker quest are pretty fun, but everything else? not really fun... (well maybe that unnescesary Mewtwo battle so you can get his OP mega evolution... yeah, maybe)

PKMN Amie and Super Training: Cool Additions, but I prefer Amie because... MAKING GIRATINA LOVE YOU IS AMAZING!

About that difficulty tho... The Gym Leaders and The Elite 4 only having 4 Pokemon is stupid, who thought of that idea.....

NOW THE EXP. SHARE! F**K IT, that's the main cause of why the game is so freaking easy and the exp share main purpose is now to give exp to all your pokemon! GREAT IDEA, RIGHT!? nope, stupid IF ONLY for the Post game, is very necessary by then if you want to complete the pokedex as fast as possible :P

Well that's it, thanks for reading and have a nice day :3"

  ",7,"To start off, I really did enjoy this game. I love the graphics, the music and the new features.
Its as I remember from the previous gens. Catch Pokemon, train them, beat the elite four, catch em all.
The mechanics are the same and nothing is changed to ruin its reputation in the franchise.

The main 3 problems I have with this game are the following:

EXP share - I get it. But to offer this at the beginning of the game takes away that desperation of training your Pokemon to beat the gym ahead of you. Every other game made you work for your success. Red,Blue and Yellow had this 3/4's of the game so you had to make progress to earn it. In this, you simply use 1 Pokemon in your whole party and everything levels up. We just got it far too easy this gen.

Easy Difficulty - I guess this ties to the EXP share too, but the overall gameplay is also on easy mode. I don't think there was one battle where I struggled

Nothing after the Elite Four - So I'm pretty sure we were all waiting to see what we will get to do after the Elite Four? Well I have to say it was insulting that nothing else was waiting for us after our previous experiences with the other games. Ok you can look for the megastones, but nothing exciting unlocks. Thats where the game died for me.

Now I'll explain why I gave it a relatively high score.
I loved the competitive gameplay. The EV/IV training was a great feature in this and much more simplified for players to get into.
The environments were very immersive as well. I enjoyed taking in the scenery while exploring the region.
The graphics, battle sequences, animations and music also made this game for me.

They kept the core of the gameplay the same. Just refreshed, more competitive and for everyone to enjoy.
If it wasnt for those flaws, this game would be amazing. Again, I really did enjoy this game and its certainly one of the top 10 3ds games in my opinion."

  ",8,"Pokemon X and Y are excellent games that attempt to take the series to another level. However, despite multiple new additions to the game, when all is said and done, you cannot help but feel slightly disappointed and left wondering what might have been.

Pokemon X and Y follow the same basic plot that all games preceding it have done. You take the reins as a young boy or girl in a very small town and are called away to receive a Pokemon and go on a journey. Throughout the journey, you will take on the staple 8 gyms and the default evil organisation ( this time called Team Flare), save the world and become Pokemon League champion. This is not a bad thing but story wise it is slightly bland and returning players may feel like they have seen it all before.

Pokemon X and Y have attempted to change the whole fabric of the series by implementing a new type to the game- the fairy type and a new concept mega evolution ( where your Pokemon can take on a new form during battle). The fairy type has drawn a large amount of criticism from the millions of existing Pokemon fans but I am pleased to say that the new typing works rather well. It was brought in to balance out the strength of the dragon type which has always been lauded as the strongest. However, the new typing can only change so much because only 70 new Pokemon were added to the ever growing family. The designers have defended this by saying that the new mega evolution of Pokemon makes up for this lower number but even the number of Pokemon that can mega evolve is quite disappointing- only around 30 of the 700+ Pokemon there are. The fact that some of the already established Pokemon have become fairy types ( such as Wigglytuff and Gardevoir) almost seems like the game creators are cheating you out of some new Pokemon.

The 70 new Pokemon are very well designed with a good mix ranging from the standard bird type Pokemon Fletchling to the floating sword Aegislash and the cute charm of the electric mouse Dedenne. However, not all of these Pokemon are hits: the Pokemon Slurpuff is an odd mix between meringue and dog- that just looks odd and feels like a real stretch. Despite this, there are more hits than misses and you cannot expect everyone to like every design.
The criticisms made thus far dwindle in comparison to the fact that there is near to no post-game gameplay. Bar searching for a few mega stones, completing a short quest in Lumiose City and battling in the Battle Maison, there is nothing to do. This is fine because the pure number of Pokemon you can catch and train in the game is very large and can make up some of the deficit but considering the extent of post-game content in Pokemon Black and White 2, you are left feeling as if the game was rushed to production and that the release should have been delayed until all the kinks were worked out.

Two more of the new features: Super Training and Pokemon Amie consist of short mini games to assist with EV training in the former and to increase the happiness level in the latter. Super Training is fun at first but soon becomes tiresome due to the repetitive nature of the game- there is only so many times you can fire footballs at a giant Pokemon shaped balloon before it becomes tedious. Nevertheless, this can be useful for players who want to enter online tournaments and want to train their Pokemon to be ready for them. Pokemon Amie is a very good addition.  During this minigame, you can play with your Pokemon in different mini games, pet your Pokemon and even feed it sweets. This area will really appeal to younger fans of the Pokemon series as well as older fans who always wanted to stroke Pikachu!
Pokemon X and Y are presented beautifully; this is without question as the transition from 2D sprites to fully 3D animations has truly evolved. However, there are a few problems with this upgrade. Firstly, the overworld map is not in 3D ( i.e. the 3D slider has no effect)- this is an odd choice for a game on a console that is based around the use of 3D. The reason why this is done is apparent once you begin to battle with the 3D slider on. The game has a strong lag and in some moves it is almost unbearable; there have been countless times that I have thought that the game had crashed but in matter of fact it was just having to slow down the framerate to make the game playable. A real shame and something most fans will expect to be fixed come the November release of Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby.
The Pokemon in the game still have the same 'screeching' sound that they did back in the previous generation; albeit a cleaner sound. This does not include Pikachu who now says 'Pika Pika' when entering battle and also has special sounds in Pokemon Amie. This is a great addition but also leaves you wondering why they cannot implement this for all the Pokemon in the game.
Despite the multiple flaws in Pokemon X and Y  the fact is, it is still a wonderful addition to the Pokemon franchise.

There's a few fun extra features thrown in and it looks a lot prettier but for the most part it's the same 50-60 hours of quality gaming that we expect to be re-released every year or two so while they're not getting massive points for innovation I can't deny they have made something that just never seems to get old. The online is also really cool. I've spent upwards of 20 hours trading and battling over the internet.
If I'm completely honest the only thing I don't like about it is the new Fairy type. With the exception of the legendary Xerneas the Fairy types all look like one of the developers let their 4 year old daughter design them. Also none of them are particularly useful in battles either."

There is no post game content other than the Looker Missions which are okay. However it is presented beautifully and the addition of Fairy types is AWESOME! It's strange how much this game is being praised because it is very forgettable and honestly there are very few memorable Pokemon and very few Pokemon in general. The legendaries are cool and all, but nothing to write home about. Character customization is cool, but there aren't many options. The game is laughably easy, and it is nowhere near the best Pokemon game. However it is the best for beginners because of its faster and also easier gameplay."

  ",8,"With  amazing, colorful 3D graphics, amazing soundtrack, and new interesting Pokemon, this game is a must have on the 3ds. EV training has become much more approachable thanks to super training which i'm sure will make it competitive play much more approachable to new trainers. The addition of mega evolution opens up evolution to many Pokemon which makes many more Pokemon more viable options to use on your team. This game also is much more detailed than any other Pokemon game. The sprites all have motion that makes everyone feel alive in a battle setting that is just as detailed as the Pokemon. There are however some flaws which hold it back from being the best that no one ever was. Once you beat the game, there is little to do in the after game unlike previous Pokemon games, like Whitetree Hollow in White/Black 2, or how you unlocked Kanto in SoulSilver/HeartGold. You instead get a single city with its own version of a battle arena that is nothing to get excited about.  There also, while well designed, fewer new Pokemon in this generation then any other, especially when the last generation had 156 to this gens 69. Luckily, there will be pokemon from every gen to catch, so don't think there will only be a few Pokemon to catch. Nevertheless, this is a game that will satisfy that Pokemon crave that we all have and deliver an enjoyable experience to any who play it."

  ",6,"I was a big fan of Red and Blue, and have not played a single pokemon game since that generation. I decided to take the plunge and see what has happened to the pokemon world since I was last a part of it, and I must say: I was a bit disappointed.

The positives in this game are what people have said already- stellar graphics, character customization, online play, etc. I agree with most of these sentiments, except that I don't understand the appeal of the online play. Additionally, the character customization is not my kind of thing. But yes, the graphics are gorgeous (except I did run into some frame rate issues, which really surprised me).

As for the negatives, I can point out a few- I read one review that praised the number of minigames that this game provides. I disagree- I see them as a dramatic timesink that only serves to provide marginal buffs to your pokemon. Spending hours in the balloon matches and punching bags provides my pokemon with additional power, but they're incredibly redundant and not terribly effective. Plus, every time I decided to swap out one pokemon for another, I felt obligated to train that new pokemon up to the same levels as my previous pokemon, which means i had to sink lots of time into just tapping my bottom screen.

The other significant downside I faced was the sheer number of pokemon in the game- having not played since there were only 150, I was surprised to see pokemon that were: pumpkins, chandeliers, keyrings, swords, and many, many nondescript blobs. In addition, the addition of new types provided an additional level of complexity to the combat system. I can't tell you how many times I had a pokemon faint in a fight to a move whose type I did not know and could not understand how it was super-effective against my pokemon. I had one battle where a single psychic pokemon 1-hit KO'd 4 of my pokemon in a row because a) he was faster than my pokemon and b) he happened to have a move that was super effective against each one. I also could almost never determine the type of a pokemon while I was battling it- ""is that pokemon dark or steel? I forget which one's super-effective against which!"". The only way to overcome this was to have my tablet handy nearby to research the pokemon's type and see what was effective against it. Doing this almost trivialized the game, however, but I felt it was necessary in my fights against the Elite Four because otherwise I faced the prospect of all my pokemon being 1-hit KO'd by some random move that the opposing pokemon happens to know (e.g. I once had a Slowbro use Flamethrower on me!).

Finally, the plot: Pokemon Red and Blue had memorable locales and events, like the Pokemon Tower, Silph Co., S.S. Anne, and the Safari Zone. Not so with this one- this game's ""highlight"" is a hilariously over-the-top world-threatening phenomenon that can't possibly be explained or reasoned with. Wonderful.

All in all, the game is good if you you've been keeping up on your generations, but I feel like if you've been holding out, wondering if you need to get back into pokemon in your later years, that there's almost no reason to come back."

  ",7,"Hopefully this game is just a starting point for future releases with its same features. Not that I play Pokemon for the story, but after the overly long main playthrough of gym leaders and Team Hipsters, you are left postgame-less. There's the battle mansion I guess, but at higher levels it gets artificially difficult, although in the context of pokemon it may not be all that bad (if you view it as a ""get out of this situation"" minigame, in which the situation is an opposing pokemon with powers the player does not have such as infinite luck). Region was ok-ish, rivals were just too many to care and not doing much anyway, customization was a nice idea done poorly due to lack of variety.

Now that's the game itself's impression I had, as for the actual generation: they did VERY good with the new pokemon, as in making few of them but quality, and most of them have very competitive characteristics to the point that some of them almost looked like (good) fan-made ones. ""Mega-evolutions"" are... a thing, I guess. I can't really say wether they are good or not, while i understand those who saw it as an unnecessary thing, ultimately you should see it as a new, arbitrary mechanic that can take many forms and make some changes and that is that (plus the obvious eye-candy factor because ""ooooooh mega evolutions cooool"", remember that this game has the biggest chunk of target audience consisting of kids). Speaking of target audience, shinies farming and breeding are made way easier: it's still an excruciatingly tedious thing, but I would never expect the game to go ""full online simulator"" by just making you insert IVs and EVs by typing them: it's not what this game is about. I would usually see such a thing with spite, but in Pokemon I guess it's contextual: it's what it is.

Arguable decisions: giving Mawile a mega evolution when it could very well be made an evolution, Fairy type could have been avoided if they instead balanced the other types (which they did anyway, therefore it wasn't an issue with retconning as usual, so I really don't get it, but whatever)."

  ",7,"The new fully animated 3D Pokemon models are a breath of fresh air, and the addition of random matchmaking for online battles is also pretty good, even though I would have liked more search options. However, there a few issues which hold the game back from a higher score. One is the lack of a cooperative online feature like the Battle Tower from Pokemon Platinum. You CAN do local co-op at the Battle Maison, but that's not convenient. Secondly, in terms of battling, even though you can now use TMs to teach your Pokemon a certain move an infinite number of times, one of the most important ones, Stealth Rock, is missing. Some Pokemon learn it naturally, but for many others the only way to acquire it is to transfer them from the older generation of games which is quite frustrating and just seems like a cheap way for Nintendo to sell you on their new Pokebank service. Lastly, the lack of post-game challenges is really noticeable, as there's not really anything to do once you beat the Elite 4 other than breed and battle. If these issues could be addressed it would mean the difference between a really good game and an excellent one, but as usual it seems Nintendo is purposely excluding content as a means of stringing people along for the next addition to the series."

  ",7,"Pokemon X/Y Review

I have play nearly every game since the 3rd generation and onward and with the new release of X and Y, so it’s no surprise that I would purchase this. Many claim that this is hands down the best game in the best game in the entire series, with that I reply with a yes, and a no.

Gameplay: Gameplay by no suprise follows the same exact formulaic style it has had since the very beginning and really hasn’t changed one bit, so don’t expect any surprises with it’s turned base gameplay. Though the gameplay mechanics that affect the overall experience are a key component to the gameplay, I decided to put that in another section due to the large amount of new mechanics. The same formula is intact from the very beginning, turned base monster vs monster action RPG where you collect monsters from various areas, defeat trainers, and become the best trainer there ever was. The same system is still intact since the very beginning,with a new region, new Pokemon, and new adventure. X and Y introduces a grand total of over 60 new pokemon, which I must say is a pitifully small roster, and a new type Fairy. So in terms of gameplay additions, there isn’t a whole lot added though this is what every new generation does so that really isn’t a surprise. But the same system is intact and probably never will  so take that as you may.

Music and Sound: The music is of the same quality it was before, very fast paced, energetic,  light-hearted, and occasionally epic. Though there are a couple of odd tracks that aren’t typical of the series, but it’s not to say it was bad by any stretch of the imagination. X and Y’s music still contain the same level of quality as the other games in the series. As for other simple sounds there is very little to say about it, the only sounds you consistently hear throughout the game are clicks, cries of Pokemon, and effects from attacks. It all sounds fine enough and there really isn’t much else to say.

Graphics: As for the graphics, being on a much more powerful system the game looks great,
the actual Pokemon battles look fantastic, with crisp clean sprites and impressive battle animations, but it does suffer it’s fair share of framerate issues. Though the open world sprites and areas could look more polished and refined, it still does look pretty damn good for a handheld game. There honestly isn’t much else to say about it, it looks rather well on a small device.

Mechanics: The mechanics of X and Y by far is the greatest advancement to the series and the best part about the game which can only move the series forward, adding fresh ideas to the formulaic gameplay that has gotten somewhat stale. The game introduced one of the most robust additions to the series, Mega Evolutions, to the table and it does somewhat make up the extreme lack of new pokemon. These are temporary transformations that last for a battle and can only be used once, they are essentially new forms of certain previous Pokemon that provide a huge increase in their power. Though this may seem ludicrously game breaking, well that’s because it is, considering they provide no negative effects at all other than a slight decrease in some stats for some Pokemon, so there is really no point in not using it throughout the game. Considering all the ridiculously powerful bonuses your Pokemon receives are insanely broken but a hell of a lot of fun to use. Another new addition is the ability to customize your trainer allowing you to purchase clothes at shops and change freely throughout your adventure, though this may seem a rather minor addition, it is a long time desire of myself and fans to customize your character the way we want that isn’t choosing whether or not we’re a boy or girl. X and Y also introduced one of the most needed changes to the series, Super training. Super Training essentially makes the long tedious process of EV training into an understandable and easier task by having your Pokemon go through a series of challenges where Pokemon gain stats according to the assigned match. This process allows players who desire better stats but don’t want to go through a redundant process to play a simpler and funner alternative. There are plenty of other mechanics that were introduced like a more convenient online system, Pokemon Amie, and many others that provide the series a huge advantage over the older games, driving the series in the right step for gameplay and mechanics into the right direction. However for the story front, that is a different tale.

Story: By far, the story in X and Y has to be the most shallowest story told in the main series Pokemon games, and considering it’s track record of stories, that says quite a lot. Though I can’t really judge it’s common formula of collecting badges and challenging the elite four considering that is what every Pokemon game is about. I chose to instead talk about everything that isn’t a common trope in the series. First off are the new villains, Team Flare, and by god these new villains are laughably bad and are just awful at what they do, their apparent goal is to destroy the world and cleanse all the evil that resides in it, so they may create a new and beautiful world away from all the vile people that exist. Now the plot of the villains’ is actually very intriguing and philosophical, it does make me think maybe the world will be perfect if we start a clean new slate. But the execution of Team Flare is atrocious, they act more humorous than threatening, removing all sense of danger.Considering the fact that there has never been one instance in which I was concerned, threatened or even cared about the villains’ plans or there plan. It was most likely due to their incompetence how goofy they act being what ruined the philosophical point of the story. Plus, their main villain is just bland, he is revealed early on as an ally and rambles on about the world being filled with scum and banters on about creating a beautiful world, and it becomes painfully obvious that he is in fact the big bad guy, and they even treated his reveal as a bad guy so nonchalantly, it’s like the creators knew people would of figured it out. So for the conflict and villains it falls flat on its face, they attempted to create a sort of philosophical kind of villain, but failed horribly. It’s not like the series of games never had a decent conflict or villains, considering they have had a fair amount. Though this issue may be excused had there been a fair amount of memorable and astounding moments along the journey, but yet again X and Y fails on this front as well. There were very few stand moments within the story, sure the introduction to mega evolutions was great but that is but a few memorable parts in the story, most are rather short. None of the Team Flare encounters were the least bit threatening or memorable, no unique stand out areas to explore, and not a whole lot of interesting gyms either. If you were to compare the memorabilia of many of the other games in the series to X and Y you’ll see the issue. As for the characters, some of the characters were not too bad, if not incredibly annoying at times. There is of course the professor, the rival, the gym leaders, the companions, and the silent protagonist, it is the same formulaic traits of all Pokemon games to date so don’t expect any robust and new characters to the series. So all in all, the story was sub par for the series, which is quite a low, with a group of ridiculous villains, little to no memorable moments, and no new fresh changes to the overall story make it an abysmal attempt at a story and only holds the series back from having an exceptional and well done story.

Verdict: Even though the story falls short on the common expectancy of a Pokemon game or any game in that regard, the new mechanics provides the series a bold new advancement on this front and is a step in the right direction. The game looks great on a handheld device, the gameplay is still intact, and whole collection of mechanics that makes the whole game more accessible leads me to give Pokemon X and Y a 7/10"

There's only 69 new Pokemon, which is bull crap. Also, why did they remove seasons? Why did they get rid of the TM Dive? Why did they remove the Pokemon World Tournament?!? WHY DO WE NEED BADGES FOR TMS AGAIN?!!?!?? The only major enhancements to game play are inverse battles, mega evolution, and the graphics.

Pokemon is just one of those games that just does not get old no matter how many iterations come out. The graphics are an enormous step up from previous games, no more flat sprites or sprites in a 3D realm, all charcaters, items, pokemon, places, are 3D models and it makes the game absolutely beautiful. While X is easier than the older games (I had no trouble at all getting through the Elite Four), it was still a great game to play and I have moved onto the online scene trying my hand, or team in this case, against others. Playing X reminded me what it was like to work my way up to the top all over again, something I haven't experienced since the Johto remakes.

  ",6,"After owning the game since the release, I finally decided to make a review over it.

While there's some amazing things they did with this game, along with graphical communication, better breeding, and better wifi communication, overall the game itself just feels like a recycled version of their post releases.

The one thing that REALLY bothers me, first of all, is the characters in this game.  Where is my rival that wants to smell me later, where is the rival that hates my guts and wants to tear me down?  Instead of giving me something exciting, they give me this huge group of boring over the top friendly ""friends"" who I cannot stand and leave me nothing absolutely memorable about them what-so-ever.  I barely even remember their names, that's how watered down and boring these characters are.  Even the bad guys don't seem so bad.  It's just a generic boring, I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD story WITH THE ULTIMATE POKEMON.  The bad guys seem like a joke honestly.

The only things I can say that stands out about this game and is pretty friggen sweet would be the fact that you can dress up your character, do your character's hair, etc.  The graphics look amazing, moving IVs to Pokemon is easier.. and I think that's about it.  Oh yeah, perhaps the fairy type was kind of cool.  That was a new twist.

The Amie, while being cute, wasn't really that impressive.  The Pokemon animations in battle felt a bit stale.

Look, I'm going to say this, Nintendo really needs to get with the program.  You can only recycle a game so much until it becomes stale.  This game was fun for about a week, I was super excited about it, but that died down very quick.  I thought the game would bring back the feelings I had during my childhood as I played the game, I had high hopes for it, but it didn't hold my interest and I was really certain it would.

After this game, I've decided I'm not going to buy a new Pokemon game ever again.  Until there is an actual MMO that is released in regards to Pokemon, where I can travel the world with other trainers, I have zero interest in this franchise anymore.  I've been playing Pokemon games on and off since 1998, and I thought I'd be interested in it forever, but yeah.. I'm done.  I hope Nintendo decides to make a more player interactive game one day, and if they do I'll be back."

The gameplay graphics were smooth, and the creators managed to mix some fun and interesting new elements in well with the classic Pokemon games we know and love, like in mega evolution. Also, I'm just going to get this over with: (and I know it's a very common complaint about this game)
Pokemon X and Y was very easy to beat. They should have added a challenge mode, like in Black 2 and White 2

I thought Kalos as a region was pretty awesome, but it was a tad easy to navigate. The fact that you get FOUR rivals excited me at first, but you only battle them 2 or 3 times with the exception of 1, though that rival's team number never exceeds 3 Pokemon, and none of them are particularly strong.

I'm not complaining about the new Pokemon,  since most if not all of them were pretty awesome. I thought the whole 'giving you 3 starters' (counting mystery gift torchic) thing was pretty ridiculous, it completely ruined the whole Pokemon 'my starter is the strongest!' mindset.

One thing I'm pretty sure annoyed every long-time Pokemon fan was the very disappointing post-gameplay, i.e nothing to do after you beat the e4. This gives the player no desire to replay the game, other than to try out a different team or starter.

All in all: Good game, too easy, good new pokes, but no post-game or real challenge.

I wouldn't go as far as to say the whole game was rushed, but in my opinion, it didn't live up to the quality of the old ones. I feel like the series went downhill when it hit the DS. This may just be nostalgia talking but I will try to explain why I feel Pokemon X isn't as good as people are making out the so-called, ""masterpiece"", to be. The game feel so easy, due to the now overpowered exp. share, it took me 1 try to beat the elite four and the champion. This game somehow manages to pack in less content than some of the GBA titles. The only way to reface gym leaders is to play the tragically boring Battle Maison, which they only appear at random. Once you have beat this game, don't expect to pick it up again, as Pokemon X literally offers no post-game content.

  ",7,"I will not lie - this game was the reason I got myself a 3DS. When you think about it, it doesn't sound that weird, even when taking into account that I'm a grown man. A Pokemon game, to me and to many others, is that special place where we want to go to experience the pure and carefree times of childhood once more. This time change has started, a few years late, and hasn't come all the way. I'd like to start off with a little research did. Since I can't proclaim it as legitimate because I can't be 100% certain, from what I gathered, around 35%+ of people who purchase Pokemon games are adults. Just throwing it out there so you can take it in while I do my thing.
Starting off with graphics - I can't start with anything else with ""the first fully 3D Pokemon game"" - I must say I'm rather disappointed. For a 3D game that doesnt look all that well, it puts some weird strain on the 3DS hardware. There is loads of lag, plus the fact that most of the time you simply can't use the 3D effects of the system, which kind of beats the point of the game being on the system. And even if you can and do - FPS goes down. The Pokemon style is still some type of weird noseless anime, and I find it more and more repulsive. The male and female body shapes almost look identical, some pokemon that need separate male and female models don't have them: In other words - this game lacks graphical polish. At times it looks like a fan-game.
I was most surprised from the Soundtrack of this game - it's quite nice. I'm even thinking of buying it. It was a nice surprise. I haven't looked up composers, but I'm pretty sure it's not the same guy who did the previous games. One disappointing thing about the sound in this game is that they didnt bother to add new FX for Pokemon - Gen 1 Pokemon still have their 8-bit cries and they sound really outdated on a 3DS. Also, what gives with the lack of voice acting? It's the 21 century!
Storywise, this game is absurd. The story is stupid. It wasnt even funny this time around - it's been recycled too many times now. Dialogue is really awkward and out of place sometimes. They took out the whole ""Rival"" aspect absolutely in this one. You do have some sort of ""Rival"", but it's not Garry MF Oak. Old players will get what I mean.
Gameplay, ofcourse, is where this game shines. I have to be honest, this game I had the most fun with out of all the Pokemon games. I still love SoulSilver more than any other, but this one is pretty awesome too, and I still do recommend it solely for this reason. At times it has a lot of fan service, paced well, that will make a lot of people happy. Though, be cautious - it really is more casual than usual. But, truth be told, you can make the game harder for yourself. I did and it was loads of fun.
In conclusion... this game was a insanely large disappointment. And I will tell you what I gathered from it. The developers of this game are not good devs. They simply aren't. The only reason The Pokemon Company still exists is because Pokemon is Pokemon and it WILL sell no matter what. This is by all means not a good game and it is blatantly obvious - it is programmed badly, it lacks essential things that every pokemon player wants - things that are not that hard to program (I'd know), the game is not at all optimised for the system and the worst - with every next game they get more and more casual and childish, because that is what Nintendo is now. Remember my opening statement? Even if it is wrong, still a large percent of pokemon players are adults. I'm not saying this to say that all pokemon games should be more hardcore (though a more-mature Pokemon game would be awesome) I still prefer a 20 hour journey into my childhood. But I'm smart enough to know when a game is not well constructed and is being released almost unfinished just because it can get away with it - because it's Pokemon and people WILL buy it, like I did. And that most certainly doesn't mean that I should stop playing Pokemon games. It means that The Pokemon Company isn't innovative. Remember the first Pokemon game? That was innovative for the time - the whole concept. Later on, Gold/Silver - you had Pokemon following you and friendships and what not - still a step up. Even Black/White had some story progression and 3D camera play. This one is the first fully 3D pokemon game, but it's an incomplete package. Somehow, with that statement, I expect it also to be voice acted, to be optimised and to have new FX. I'd much rather have that than a new Pokemon generation consisting of even more uninspired pokemon with OP stats, like the previous 2 generations. And I'm sure most players will agree. My 6YO nephew got recently into Pokemon, without having played or watched anything Pokemon related before. Guess what - his faves are Charisard and Blastoise. Hardly a coincidence.
To sum it up: Pokemon X/Y is outdated by itself, it's an incomplete package and should not be praised for what the Genesis did 30 years ago."

Also the upgrades on little things like the skating feature and photo taking make the whole game even more awesome! Look forward to a better player interaction system rather than having us to press button to log into Internet every time I close the lid of my 3DS, I found that a bit too annoying."

  ",5,"I became a fan of the Pokemon series with the release of Pokemon Emerald, flying through that game and Firered within a few short weeks. I was captivated by Diamond when it was released in 2007, and again felt joy when playing through Soulsilver in 2010. However, I disliked the Generation V games - the gameplay was too repetitive, the Pokemon designs were ugly, and I just could not attach myself to any of the characters.

In the months leading up to the release of Pokemon X and Y, I grew excited again. The new Pokemon designs were, for the most part, fantastic - and while I disliked the exclusivity of Mega Evolutions and that they only activate during battle, I thought they were a cool concept. Visually, Pokemon X is spectacular, although the frame rate drops noticeably if the 3D feature is activated during battles. However, I dislike the music, which does not meet the standards set by the earlier generations. The region feels very small compared to earlier locales such as Hoenn, and the caves choke you in their linearity.

The worst offender is the story. While the Pokemon games have never been known for their story, at least it was there - at least it made sense and was enjoyable to watch as a side quest to whatever story you had created for yourself. That is not the case with these games. The story - if it can be called that - was quite clearly tacked on without a second thought for how it should work, and it killed the experience for me. I cannot recommend this game."

But it also has some of the best multiplier, and some really good customization options so each trainer looks unique to each player plus the music is still good like in most Pokemon games

I took my time over the story and it still only took me about 18 hours to complete. The amount of things you can do after the story has been completed is very limited and there aren't many contest like things to do within the game like Heart Gold and Soul Silver had.

Fun battling against trainers and rivals and team flare, character customization, more proportional looking characters (head to body size-ratio), character is no longer locked into a grid when biking or rollerskating, great cool new pokemon, new moves, new fairy type, and much more. The totally updated graphics, 3D models of pokemon and 3D battlefields look absolutely gorgeous! That combined with the 3D option of the 3DS makes you feel like you are literally right there next to your pokemon battling it out to be the champion of the new region. The 3D option is limited to single battles and some caves though, which is disappointing but understandable. The new moves look stunning, especially with the 3D on, and it is amazing to see the pokemon actually move around and react to using and taking damage from moves. One slight downside though is that sometimes the game lags just a little when the 3D is on. As for music and sound effects? Say good-bye to all those crappy MIDI files, the new music and sound effects for moves are amazing, I love the soundtrack! This game was the reason why I bought the 3DS and it did not disappoint. I have played almost all of the main pokemon franchise games, and Pokémon X/Y is truly an amazing game and my downright favorite in the series so far!"

What I feel disappointed in the game are: I cannot capture all the pokemons in the game; Plot is very mediocre; Post game is boring; Wifi battle only supports up to 2v2. I think if 4v4 available, will be much more fun; Frame rate drops significantly when 2v2, which is very annoying.

That's a huge shame, because they took out the scaling-EXP system from Gen5, and combined with the ""EXP All"" the game just becomes too easy; you'll quickly out level the opponents and then have nothing left to do.

On the good side: The battles look pretty great, which is nice I guess. You can find more pokemon within the game, and the friend safari lets you get potentially all the non-legendary pokemon on your own, which is cool. The pokemon breeding mechanics have been updated again, allowing you to very easily get a pokemon with maxed out stats, if you care about those last few stat points.

Overall, there's a lot of wasted potential here, and I don't think the game has staying power. In a few generations we'll care about as much about X/Y as we do about Diamond/Pearl. Perhaps the ""Z"" game later on will fix these issues."

  ",9,"Pokemon doesn't normally go out of their comfort zone. When Pokemon Red/Green released in 1996,  the series hit the ball with an excellent little top-down adventure featuring a young boy on his journey to being a Pokemon master. Gamefreak has kept that formula for future portable titles to come, from Red/Green to Black/White. Now with the new generation, comes new innovation, for X/Y, comes a new region, a new adventure, and one of the most drastic steps the series has ever taken.

With the new generation, comes a new dimension; a new way to play Pokemon. This isn't the first time a Pokemon game has experimented with 3-D, but this is the first time Pokemon has integrated full 3D throughout the entire game. This is a welcome change to a series that has kept the same formula for so long. In previous games, only certain parts of the world remained in 3D, while the rest of the world kept at a 2D top-down prospective. With every building, character, and terrain in full 3D, there is no more separation, keeping the game fluid and consistent.

Along with a full 3D world, comes full 3D Pokemon as well. The Pokemon no longer are restricted to 2-D sprites, but instead all have fully fleshed out models and animations. Each Pokemon has their own idle animation as well as attack animations bringing the Pokemon to life on the small screen. The Pokemon finally feel truly alive during combat. With the help of a fully active camera, battles feel even more engrossing as the camera pans across the combat arena, showing off each Pokemon as they attack and take hits.

The new world is still as fun to explore as previous games. Walking around and tracking down wild Pokemon in the tall grass is still exciting. That excitement remains whenever you encounter a new Pokemon you've never seen before or finally capturing that Pokemon that has eluded you for so long.
Training, putting your Pokemon to the test until they level up and finally evolve into a new creature is just as satisfying as ever and just as rewarding.

As you explore the new Kalos region, you will encounter hundreds of trainers who wish to test your skills. My personal favorite was a woman who approached me within a route covered in fallen leaves to
say “Pokeballs are round. The world is also round.” Then we battled. These interactions can offer a chuckle at times while other will leave you simply confused.

One of the main new hooks for this game is the new Mega-evolutions. These come into play about a third of the way through. Once you find the appropriate item and attach it to the appropriate Pokemon, mega evolving can be performed during battle. Its a free move that makes your Pokemon stronger during the battle, and seeing the evolution is always exciting. You can only use one mega-evolution per battle, so a player should plan accordingly. It doesn't make or break the game but its a nice addition to the mix.

One of my personally favorite new features is the new trainer customization. The player isn't forced to use a default character model as previous entries have, this time your trainer is fully customizable. Throughout the game, you will come across boutiques within certain towns. Here you can purchase new clothes, hats, and bags, with inventory changing every day. Along with the boutiques, you can find a salon where you can change your hair style and color, as well as an item that allows the player to change the color of his/her eyes. It isn't as diverse as other games that let you spend hours customizing ever little detail of a character, but its a nice change of pace having a trainer that feels truly yours.

The touch screen holds new features as well, including the traditional shortcuts to bag, Pokemon, and saving. One screen holds Super Training, where a trainer can play mini-games with their Pokemon allowing them to gain buffs on certain stats. Another screen holds Pokemon-Amie, where a trainer can interact with their Pokemon personally, feeding and petting them like you would in Nintendogs. The final screen is the “Player Search System” which allows a player to interact with friends, passerbys, and acquaintances. It is here where a player can access online battles and trades without the use of a Pokemon Center. The online system itself has its issues however. During playthrough, I have been dropped from online battles and forced to shut down my system due to communication error while trying to trade with someone. It isn't deal-breaking, simply a minor frustration I ran into a few times.

X&Y doesn't radically change the formula players are used to, but instead continue to make strides in welcoming new, inexperienced players while still remaining familiar to veterans of the series. It still feels and looks like a Pokemon game, but with its new graphics, colorful art style, 3D gameplay, and scale of depth in the new region, it makes the game more fun, attractive, and inviting. It's a fantastic first step for new players, and one worthwhile adventure for long time fans."

  ",8,"When my parents first brought me Pokemon Yellow, I don't think they understood the monster they would create.  I've always enjoyed Pokemon, and I probably always will, even though I'm out of the house now and should find better things to do with my time.

This game finally takes Pokemon into 3D, and I was extremely skeptical, but I shouldn't have feared knowing Game Freaks dedication to the main series.

What a difference 3D makes when going on the same journey again, but just with new faces.  The world is incredible, and it's great to explore these environments, especially since you can move diagonally and have roller blades to quickly move around.  Furthermore, the advent of character customization has come and it is wonderful.  Stylizing your character is another way that livens up this predictable experience into a more personal experience.  The horror of not being able to enter Lumiose City's fashion boutique really encourages you to learn how to accessorize and earn style throughout Kalos.  Such gives the experience a breath of fresh air again while maintaining the core experience.

In terms of gameplay, I don't think I need to say anything.  If you're on this site, you know what to expect.  Game Freak did add a few curve-balls to keep you on your toes though.  They added horde battles, which are cool in theory, but take way too long and the frame rate drops all too often, and then there's inverse battles, which is a fascinating diversion to say the least.  Probably the biggest curve-ball is the fairy type, which I wasn't too excited about when they announced it, nor was I too blown away by it in game.  The type chart has been changed accordingly, and some other minor changes have been made as well.  I'm still waiting for the days of dual-typed moves, although we get a glimpse of it in Flying Press.  Hopefully, they will move in that direction.

Musically, this game is different.  They've changed the style just a little bit, and sometimes it comes off great, but sometimes I never really cared for it.  They also revamped a lot of the Pokemon cries (GameSpot's long time complaint which no one cared about).

At the end of my journey with X, I was left wanting more.  This game didn't satisfy the itch.  They have made IV's easier, EV's easier, gaining experience easier, everything was easier.  Therein lies this games biggest issue.  This is probably the easiest game to date, and it's mostly due to the Exp. share.  Now, every Pokemon that participates in the battle gets full experience and everyone else gets half.  This lead my team to significantly out level pretty much everyone.  I even turned it off, but it was too late.  Ultimately, it feels like the Exp. Share is a grand cover up of the fact that this game has so little material.  I finished the core experience within 35 hours, the shortest I've ever taken for the game and the post game content as well.

This is the most polished Pokemon game to date.  It's amazing and it's wonderful, but it's too easy.  It's left me wanting more, and there is no way to fill it until the next set of games roll out.  Please Game Freak, at least for the veterans, make a challenge mode or add something to keep us occupied as this game ultimately lacked the enormous content of the previous generation."

With all the new additions to breeding, it is way easier to get your favorite Pokemon ready for online PVP battles. Plus, connecting with other players for a trade or battle was never that easy."

  ",9,"I really wish I could give this game a 9.5...

In many ways, Pokemon X revolutionizes Pokemon as we know it, there are so many fascinating additions for competitive and casual players alike. From a strategy perspective, the game's competitive scene has been balanced from the hyperoffensive style of B/W. The new fairy type works wonders for balancing the type chart, and overall, it's evident that GameFreak spent a lot of time figuring out how to make the game more interesting and strategic for players willing to dig deeply into pokemon deceptively simply battle system.

For casual players, we have interesting new features like pokemon amie, character customization, and greatly improved graphics/animations for the pokemon. Going back to B2/W2 after this game is almost unbearable, X blows them completely out of the water. I think the graphics deserve a special mention. Pokemon has never been known for being the most graphically intense game on any console it has existed on, and yet X succeeds where others have failed. This is a pretty game. Certainly not on par with games like resident evil revelations, but for pokemon, it works very well. The cel-shaded, fully animated pokemon models look gorgeous, and attacks look fresh, exciting, and well executed. The presentation in this game is top-notch.

For casual and competitive players alike, the game introduces what may be one of the most revolutionary elements in a pokemon game since we got wifi connection in D/P. The PSS. It's available right from the start at the bottom of the screen and constantly updates with information pertaining to the status of your friends or random passerbys so long as you're connected to the internet. Game chat allows you to use your 3DS as a telephone to speak with your friends, making it marvelously easy to see your friend online and challenge him/her to a battle or trade. You can give o-powers to your friends, view others PR videos, the list just goes on and on. The PSS is a huge addition to making pokemon what it was meant to be, a social game.

Why can't I give this game a perfect score despite its many strengths? Quite simply, content wise, it feels like a bit of a watered down experience compared to other pokemon games. There is very little postgame content, making this a 30-40 hour adventure and nothing more if one does not decide to jump into the world of competitive battling. Pokemon games traditionally have had so much to explore and do that they could easily last 80+ hours per run through. The lack of some old features such as gems, all the berries, and some of the old lengendaries just add to that ""new, but skinny"" generation feeling. Everyone knows that everything will become more fleshed out in Z or whatever the 3rd edition will be called. It's a little frustrating to see the signs so evidently.

Nevertheless, Pokemon X is a brilliant game that owners of the 3DS shouldn't miss. It becomes an exponentially better game when one gets involved with the huge community behind it. Even just a small group of friends who also play will make the game that much better. Of course, if one were to play it as a single player game, it's a fun little 30-40 hour RPG, and the Pokemon charm still can't be denied."

My favourite addition to the series is ""Super Training"", which is a in-depth way to train your team, the player can choose which specific skill they want to improve on their Pokémon through petting, feeding and playing (repetitive) mini-games with the select Pokémon the player wishes to train.

The addition of Super Training and other mini-games promotes a much more personal feel to training your Pokémon, bringing the player closer to being a real ""Pokémon Trainer"". It is through these feelings Game Freak evokes in us that you can see Pokémon X and Y are the best Pokémon games to date."

  ",8,"The ""Perfect"" Pokemon handheld gaming experience is finally here.
I bought this game the day of release and I must say, I was swept off my feet.
Pokemon X is the game that I I've been waiting for years for, and I will say 2 things.
There are things that I wanted that were included.
And there were things I REALLY wanted and they weren't in the game.
Let me first talk about the plot.
The plot is very basic. You and 4 friends travel around the Kalos region and defeat the forces of evil and you become champion of the pokemon league, ya know, the normal stuff. But it's after the game that makes this game go from a solid 9 to an 8.
There is little to no post game content. And the content you do have is forgettable and nothing really too ""fun"". You can battle your friends which is fun but that's pretty much it. Once you beat the game there isn't really much to do.
As for the battling, it's is a work of art. The battles are with 3d models and unlike Pokemon Stadium or Pokemon Battle revolution, the battle pace is fast and smooth and sleek and oh god I loved every moment of it. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the slow down I would get while battling online or locally in the story.  The fairy type is a very good addition and finally gives poison pokemon a reason to live. As for megas, they are cool looking, but at a competitive battling stand-point they aren't really useful. Why use a mega alakazam when I could just give is a choice scarf or life orb and have the same outcome of battle. While on topic of competitive battling, the online features of this game are amazing, It's something I hope they keep consistent in future games. Super Training and Pokemon Amie are really good too and I hope they become a staple in the pokemon franchise.
Overall, Pokemon X is a great game, but is lacking post game content. If you own a 3ds, i REALLY recommend you get it. It's 18.99 at ****!.... I think, that's what a friend told me."

  ",9,I thought this game was one of the best games in the Pokemon franchise. Starting with the 3D models ending with the mega evolution. To start the 3D models where spot on with all the architecture from Pokemon stadium with out the announcer blowing your ear out. As well as the 3D models go I think that the mega evolution was one of the best additions in all the games. Mostly the reason I chose Pokemon x was the different mega forms for charizard and mew-two (Bad Ass). The only problem I have with the game is the 3D feature. It wouldn't have been such a big issue if the frame rates didn't drop every time I put on the 3D feature in battle. So that's why i gave it a 9 out of 10.

  ",8,"Nintendo's premier handheld franchise finally hits the 3DS, and it looks like it's gonna be the console's biggest system seller yet. Boasting new 3D animations and environments, Pokémon X nevertheless plays it pretty close to home when it comes to gameplay, with scattered innovations that definitely add to the experience.

The 3D graphics in the cities and roads are pretty neat, but not a huge leap, all things considered. The game plays very similarly to previous entries, and some of the camera shenanigans have even been experimented with before in Pokémon Black and White. Sometimes those camera movements can even annoy, like what happens when you're rollerskating through Lumiose City, the game's version of Paris. The actual battles are another thing, though: every pokémon is fully animated, and the static camera angle is gone. This adds a whole new level to the battle system, making it even more enjoyable.

Perhaps the biggest change is regarding the game's online connectivity. Pokémon has always been crafted as a social game, and never has the social aspect been so accessible as it is here. Online trades of all kinds can happen anytime, anywhere (if you have access to w-fi), by a mere couple of clicks on the touchscreen. The bottom screen is also home to a pokémon training program, letting competitive players and breeders optimize their pokémon by playing fun minigames rather than grinding for stat-enhancing items.

The developers have gone out of the way to make the game faster, too, which is great news. This includes letting your character run from the get-go and the reworked Exp. Share item, which lets you level up your team in a much quicker manner. My favorite, though, is the decision to reward your team with experience points even when you capture wild pokémon, which not only helps you grind for levels, but also encourages you to stay true to the franchise's slogan and really try to catch them all. Some in-game processes are still a drag, though, like having to sort through seas of unneeded menus to simply manage the pokémon stored in your boxes. Given their focus on speedier gameplay, it seems weird to overlook that.

The story starts out as your typical Pokémon tale, with the same old kid-from-small-town-foils-criminal-organization routine. This is a formula that has stopped being fresh ten years ago, and it would really benefit from some change. Luckily, the showdown against Team Flare, the criminal organization du jour, eventually becomes a lot darker than I would expect; it has some pretty big **** undertones, which makes you actually care for a change. It's a nice surprise, which further proves how much more interesting the series would get with a more compelling storyline. A good starting point would be Nintendo's own Earthbound (or Mother, in Japan) series, which has a similar cute-RPG presentation, but manages to make its story genuinely touching and entertaining by giving attention to detail and character development.

So Pokémon X isn't a revolution for the series like many thought it would be. Personally, I don't think they need to reinvent the wheel, but some change would do it good. Luckily, the gameplay is even more addictive, thanks to the speeding up effort, while the new pokémon are varied and well designed. And of course, it has never been easier to connect with friends (and strangers!) as you brave the game's locations. All of this makes it a precious addition to the 3DS library, and well worth your time and money.

This ultimately makes the single player experience ridiculously easy, for me however it’s always been the multiplayer battles that present the real challenge.

That’s not to say it doesn’t have it’s problems.  As mentioned the single player experience is ridiculously easy, and the story is cookie cutter without any depth.

  ",9,"This game has really advanced the Pokemon series more than I thought possible. While nothing in the gameplay really has changed since the original Red/Blue games, all the advancements around that are truly what stand out. And even some of the minor things like getting EXP from captures really give the game alot of bonus points from me as it's not as grindy as past incarnations have been. Bout the only thing wrong with this game is the fact that, even for a Pokemon game, the story here is very, very bad. I know the story hasn't really changed over the years but in this particular instance, it took a nosedive off a cliff. But mindlessly crusing through it is very easy to do and getting that perfect team balance is also very nice. While I do think that the new Fairy type is a bit OP as of the time of this writing, I can't help but think it's added alot to the balance of the game in a positive way. I'm sure pretty much everyone with a 3DS has one of these two games already. I myself actually preferred the exclusives from Y better but that's very much based on my love for SP. Attack moves, but there is very little seperating the two. Definitely buy one of these two games as it'll give you hours of entertainment."

  ",5,"It's a good game that's obviously reaching towards younger audiences than previous entries to the series. This is the very first pokemon game I've ever feel like would be a better rental than an owned game.

Gameplay: It's generally the same pokemon formula. You get a starter (more than one eventually) you fight gyms, you train your pokemon, etc. It's fun, it's what has made the franchise, however I feel like this game gets very easy very quickly. Throughout the game, I lost maybe 2 or 3 battles, and those were only because I didn't have the proper supplies to battle. As for money, you win far too much of it from trainers. Before I fought the Elite 4, I was able to stock up on 99 revives, 50 hyper potions, and about 30 super repels for victory road. There are also places throughout the game that allow you to randomly heal your pokemon. Sure, this has happened in previous pokemon games, but it happens more often in this game than any other. This game just simply throws the player a bone too often.

Story: What story? You just moved into a town, the local kids try to include you in an activity and bam, you have your starter. Nobody plays pokemon games for the story, I get that, but there were a few moments where the story was just flat out bad. It's unprecedented how tacked on the story feels to this game.

Replay value: Minimal. There is a side quest that you can do to burn another hour or two, but there's nothing to keep the ds in your hands once you've beaten the game.

Overall: It's probably the worst pokemon game to date. It looks nice, it has pokemon in it, but that's all it has going for it. That being said, I did have fun in the 27 hours it took me to get to the Elite 4 and beat them.  It's a good game to rent, but not a game to buy and certainly not a game to buy a 2ds or 3ds for."

  ",9,"(In detail guide, contains few spoilers)

The game Pokemon X and Y is currently the fastest selling 3DS game to ever exist, and for good; it contains innovative features and bringing, defining and making its own expectations of content that should be available for everyone to play. It brings a new definition to the term, ""Handheld gaming"".

The storyline: 6/10
Rinse and wash, I'm afraid. It's the same story line from every other Pokémon game, except in a new region. That doesn't make it any less fun to play, though. There will always be an exciting element to every Pokémon game story, defeating bad guys, etc. It'd be nice for a change though, say making you a bad guy for once? That's just my speculation though.

Music: 9/10
The music in Pokémon will always and has always been a little bit cheesy, but Gen 6 finds me enjoying its new soundtracks as compared to repititive and annoying old Pokécentre instrumentals, etc.

Pokémon: 8/10
Though containing a few silly themed Pokémon, unlike Gen 4/5, nintendo have managed to outdo them selves this time. I actually like the Pokémon that it introduces for once, they appeal to both younger and older audience in terms of design and 'badassery'.

Starters: 9/10
The new starters are great, Chespin (and its evolutions) look a little dopey but aside from that, it's all good especially the double-counter-secondary-types. I do however, see many people giving it the thumbs down for the amount of starters you can get: 3 different starter Pokémon. However, I do not see this as a problem.
-Torchic is only an event Pokémon, don't want it? Don't get it. Simple.
-The reintroduction of the 1st gen starters has been longed for by the community for a LONG time and admit it, there're many of you that want to be able to use your Charmander (Or the other 2, biased towards Charmander though  )from FireRed/LeafGreen, since you're not able to trade them without going through 2 systems and then a Pokébank, they found a better way of introducing them.

-Method of getting from FireRed/LeafGreen (Or other GBA games):
1) Export to Diamond/Pearl/Platinum through Pokémon Pal Park.
2) Using a separate NDS, trade that pokémon to White/Black (1 or 2).
3) Upload that Pokémon to the PokéBank, also having to pay an annual cost, even for the 1 trade.
4) Receive in new game.

So what's all the fuss about giving them to you anyway? They also come with Mega  deal with it bruh.

Multiplayer: 11/10

You can literally not play this game without exploring the full excess of multiplayer possibilities, it's honestly amazing, the 3DS is such an asset to this game."

Firstly, I would like to state the fact that i live in South Asia, Pakistan; where 3ds games practically NEVER arrive... Sure, there's the occasional GTA 5 and Assassin's Creed, but it was actually very shocking to see such a game on the shelves of the few gaming stores. As soon as I saw it, I got it reserved and payed extra,  with me being such a Pokaholic! I read reviews and so many gameplay videos and the game looked amazing!

I had also seen many screenshots online, and yes, the graphics do look slightly pixelized, e.t.c. but once you get the game, the graphics have surpassed average 3ds games' overall. One thing I would like to point out is that, most parts of the game, aren't in 3D! The free-roam, and navigation isn't 3d; you turn on the depth slider, and the world is still the same. But when 3d is available, it is stunning. Especially when you have a Pokemon ""mega-evolve"".

The gameplay is very smooth and although many people say it is somewhat laggy, I don't think the same. It's a pretty smooth experience. The navigation is very fun with the roller-skates and the bike. All new mounts have also been introduced, which is a bonus. The world is very lush, and detailed, especially the lovely, Lumiose City!  All new features such as taxis, monorails, and mounted transports have been introduced as well.

The story, I have to admit, might be a little bland and childish, but it is still very enjoyable and is quite long. Gym battles are very fun and get harder and harder every time, and just reaching the actual battles is very exhilarating and exciting!

Overall, I think the game is totally worth it, and is suitable for both young and old ages. Pokemon fans like me will be amazed and instantly fall in love! The only reason why it lost one mark was because of not being able to play in 3d all the time, despite it being a 3ds exclusive... Honestly, this has to be the best and most anticipated game for the 3ds."

Pokemon is a franchise that's had a large following ever since it's arrival in the US 10+ years **** it's easy to see why. While technically geared for young children, the RPG elements here are nonetheless incredibly deep, meaning it pleases casual youngsters and hardcore players alike. It's so incredibly good that there are even tournaments held all over the place, meaning that this franchise is NOT just for kids.

Pokemon X and Y are the best things that have happened to this IP since it's origins. Having not played Pokemon seriously since FireRed, it had been a long time for me. Fortunately, the myriad of new stuff for me to enjoy is abundant in X and Y. Everything from the new pokemon, to avatar customization and various online modes are all new things that I had always wanted from earlier games and now, they are here. Super Training and Pokemon Amie are also great additions, making the process of further customizing and caring for your pokemon even deeper.

The game looks fantastic, too. Ever since pokemon stadium, players have desperately wanted a full 3D pokemon **** now it's here. And it is glorious. The art style they chose kinda reminds me of the 'Tales' series of **** while it's not very original, it nevertheless embodies pokemon better than other styles would have.

The bottom line is this: If you ever played a pokemon game and liked it, you should try this. Doesn't matter if it's been a decade since you last played, or if you never stopped playing; Pokemon X and Y are simply the best in the series so far."

Though there are also some apsects I disliked:
First, story dialogues are not very well done. The Team Flare scientists are more of a laugh then an actual challenge and what they are saying doesn't make them seem much more threatening. And they could have put more effort into Serena(your rival). Most of the time she just comes up to you and say's ""Let's battle"" and once you beat here, she leaves just as quickly.
Also the plot starts very slowly and once you come to the final parts of the battle against Team Flare, you get all the info of their plans thrown at you at once, within pretty much less than ten minutes. Some aspects of it could have been told you much earlier(like about the machine) and it would have probably made the story better.

Not only is it in beautiful 3D that was put together real nicely, but it introduced a whole new way to battle pokemon. It introduces new pokemon while keeping the old ones from even the first generation. It actually lets you choose between the ORIGINAL pokemon! Not to mention the new mega evolving for some of our favorite pokemon! I highly recommend this game for both new and long term fans of the series!"

  ",10,"Pokemon X and Y are the most definitive iterations the Grand Pokemon franchise has ever received, and that's no slouch considering every main series installment has been great. The game in 3D is jaw-dropping, and we've been waiting for a Pokemon game of this caliber and polish for years, it looks better than a full priced Wii game, which is both impressive and sad at the same time. The game's Pokedex is absolutely huge, boasting over 400 Pokemon to catch, including 68 new Pokemon plus the 30 or so Mega Evolutions introduced. The music and sound design is amazing, and surprisingly, the story is something different. You will have to see it through to the end, but in the 3rd act the writing outshines the Black and White games, and the story never outshines the fantastically solid and refined gameplay.

SO in short, buy it. Buy it now. And if you already bought it, buy it again."

I will save my compliments as I  know it's a great game but the major flaw is that it lacks replay value, after you beat E4, there's literally nothing to do that's sparks people as OOOO this is fun.

Let's take a look at Soul Silver and Heart Gold, after you beat the game, you get to explore Kanto, the game opens up a whole new world, all the gym now offers toughened up rematchs, all the variety of legendary you can catch from previous generations. X and Y has nothing

Another flaw is that the Kalos Pokemon doesn't stand out, the game throws in pokemon from previous generation from the beginning and natually people will capture ones the recognize, take a look at black and white, they give you pokemon from previous gen at a much later time this forces players to use and familiarize pokemon from this generation, I have found myself a party full of pokemon from previous generations because why risk it when I know what pokemon works?

and then there's the starters, if you count the Torchic giving to you by gift, they give you 4 starters, that's ABSURD, it completely devalues your starter pokemon.

There are flaws that keep me from spending more than 20 hours on it when each game previously would take me 100 hours each, great game, but needs work"

It's got great online features like Wonder Trade (which I love getting bidoofs) and Battle Spot (battle random people online). They also have the usual GTS and normal trade/ battle.

  ",8,"I have been rather disassociated with Pokemon games since Yellow, as they seemed a bit rehashed... However this new generation as reinvigorated the series with a MUCH NEEDED revamp of how the game looks, behaves, and even feels while playing. If you have the slightest interest in the Pokemon series, or coming back to it  X/Y is the generation to do it in. Personally I have X, so that's why I'm writing on this one...

Cons...
The varying ways that they handle the character movement, swapping from over the shoulder, to top down can be a bit confusing for controls, but generally not an issue after playing a bit.
Some of the move animations for the Pokemon seem a bit backwards, such as a tackle animation used for vine whip, and a vine whip animation used for tackle  it's a bit annoying.

This last thing isn't really a con, because it's actually a pro for the game  though implementation could have been better... Pokemon X/Y have voice chat  but it completely disables you from continuing play. I really wish they'd allow a continuous text chat with friends, and also the voice chat should be able to work along with the game, not one or the other."

  ",10,"Coming from a person who has been playing the series since Red; somebody please help me, I am utterly captivated. This is the best installment. Where to begin.

The stupidly huge Pokemon count, the pokedex has to be divided into three sections because of this.

Roller Skating is cool, would have preferred skateboarding (or the option) however the skating can be a bit clunky and dominates the circle-pad which leaves the player to use the clickity d-pad for walking.

The Gym's and Gym leaders are all great, for the first time in Pokemon history the gyms are worth re-visiting after completion.

The photography is a nice addition but I would have liked to be able to take pictures anywhere rather than just select locations.

The 3d looks great, coming from a 3d animator these models are simply sublime. It's a shame that the 3d effect only works in select instances but I never used the 3d in the first place. The levels themselves are the best they have ever been in any previous installment, Lumiose City is utterly breath-taking.

The fighting is actually entertaining to watch, in past installments due to the 2d limitations I always tried to rush through battles because they always felt synthetic, now you can actually feel the impact of attacks.

The new Pokemon are hit and miss, half of them look utterly jaw dropping and dance over the crown-hailed first generation, while the other half are some of the worst they've conjured. Forewarning, the starting Pokemon in this game are nothing to be desired.

----------

I cannot praise this game enough, every-time I open my 3ds I lose around 5 hours of my day, completely worth it; Pokemon X and Y have not forsaken us; contrary to other series that are this old."

  ",10,"Pokémon X&Y is one of the best pokémon games, many upgrades have been put into this game, which made it really fresh. The gameplay is as great as always, the only thing that I felt, is that it's much easier than any other pokémon game, this might be good or bad depending on what kind of gamer you are. If you are a hardcore fan, you might feel disappointed, but if you are new to this franchise, you will be pleased for this changes. The graphics are just amazing and it is the best-looking pokémon game EVER made, the 3D models are much better than 2D sprites and it makes the game look fresh. The only problem I had with the graphics is that the framerate fails sereiously when you are playing on 3D and specially when you are playing in a wheather area (rain, sandstorm, etc.), but other than that, it's flawless. The music is just as good as always, great and catchy songs that will stay in your head for a long time. The environments look great and the cities are just amazing, I am impressed about how well they look. The pokémon designs are... good. They are not amazing, but they are NOT horrible as many people would say. The mega-evolutions are a great addition to the game, and they might change the course of a battle completely, these mega-evolutions are fun to use and look great.
My final veredict is that this is the biggest evolution for pokémon since Gold & Silver, I just loved it and I must say I am a huge fan of this franchise since the very first game, so I don't really understand why many fans are disappointed.

  ",10,"Having played (and owning) every other cartridge in the series, I feel that I'm fairly qualified to make judgement on this game.  This is the ONLY time that I have only purchased one of the released pair, mainly because I only have 1x 3DS console (the kids have one each, but I normally have 2 for trades and breeding etc).  Anyway, I've logged about 10 hours of gameplay into this Pokemon X game, and i must say I'm very impressed with the graphic and sound upgrades.  The musical tunes seem a lot more dynamic than the last two offerings, using more sound 'voices' to bring the music to a more refined tone.  This game is one of very few that I actually play the game with the sound on, and last night, I even had my headphones in so I could enjoy it louder.  That said, I wish they were able to merge the sound effects into the main track when leveling up etc, as that mutes the music to take focus.

The graphics:  I quite like the larger view from the older 'sprite' styles used since 1998.  Don't get me wrong, that little character was instantly recognizable to any fan, but this is much better on my eyes.  Since I'm probably the oldest Pokemon gamer (39), I feel that gamefreak/Nintendo are trying to branch out in to a more mature gaming body.  It looks almost Zelda OoT style during the normal walking around.  The 3D feature is only active during battles, not that I care as I have my 3DS-XL's slider all the way down in 2D mode anyway.  I did take a look at the 3D just for kicks though.

The gameplay:  The tried and proven turn based RPG.  The reading is not that difficult and nowhere near as over the top as previous games either.  It's nice to hear some Pokemon having their own voices, and not the weird white noise generated.  Pikachu is a standout for that!

Anyway, enough of this rambling!!!  I'm heading back to catch a few more of the little beggars!!!"

There is crazy many pokemons to catch and time flies when you play, what more can you ask really, I am quite sure I will play this game more than anything for years so if that is not worth 10/10 What is then? Yet still this game is nowhere near prefect, I have two complaints that hopefully will be done better in future generations: Firstly, difficulty level isn't quite hard enough, at least gym leaders could have higher level pokemons so that you wouldn't so easily over train your pokes before reaching them and though beating them too easily. Secondly there is some issues with framerate in battles, specially when you use 3D."

  ",9,"Pokemon X and Y is my new favorite entree into the franchise. The 3D sprites are fantastic to watch. The new 3D movements really bring to life, the Pokemon in battle. The game itself only introduced 60 Pokemon (more or less), but the addition of around 20 mega evolutions to discover, the game is chalk full of seemingly endless fun. Especially when you consider how much easier X and Y make it to EV train your Pokemon. Competitive battling is about to get that much more interesting, oh and the addition of the NEW Fairy Type will shake things up for sure. X and Y are not your typical addition to the franchise, they do absolutely everything right and then some! More Pokemon are added, more moves are added, all the typical things you would think are in the game, but the game has gone above and beyond my expectations with all the extra stuff that technically The Pokemon company did not ""have"" to add. Mega evolutions are an example of this. They could have left them out altogether, but I really appreciate the change to the meta game and it also gives us older fans a reason to raise some of our old favorites again!

Pokemon X and Y is easy enough to be enjoyed by newcomers to the series, but also introduces a cornucopia of brand new material not found in any other iteration to the franchise and thus is also perfect for veteran Pokemon fans.  That is why I believe X and Y deserve a 10/10. It is simply a perfect game with no flaws that I could tell. I will be playing it for a long, long time and I know for a fact there are many other people out there who will do just the same.

It is, however, very refreshing to see the game break away from the cardboard cut-outs sliding across the screen. It also does a nice job of trying to give you a mix of both new and old Pokemon, so even the old Genwunners like me (that's right, 1st generation is  best!) can feel comfortable in the game.

The multiplayer has also improved dramatically, allowing you to interact with people at the same place in the game as you from anywhere else in the world. Trading and battling has become A LOT more relevant for people that don't have a ton of pokemon-playing friends or don't live in Japan.

The visuals look wonderful (they are really, really stunning!), the music is topnotch, the pokemon selection is fantastic, and the step into trainer customization (everything  from hair style and colour to your skin tone to all of your clothes and accessories) and the really fun online social features really make XY a joy to play alone or with your friends. This last point in particular is great  users can send O-Powers (little features that can increase the prize money received or increase your pokemon's stats in-battle) to their friends whenever you'd (or they'd!) like, send presents, chat, instant-battle, and display when you reached an achievement (i.e. ""Second badge! :D"") and then respond (""Nice!"") The online and offline features are intertwoven seamlessly. Also, they fixed the  childish dialogue from BW2! There are also quite a few little jokes that made me smile. The world is also very immersive, and while a few features from BW and BW2 didn't make it in (custom gym music, for one), XY added PLENTY, from the small such as being able to ride pokemon and more pokemon in the overworld to the large, such as Mega Evos. XY is definitely worth your money and time. Downside is that the 3D (as in pop-out-of-screen) is sparsely used and isn't worth using at all when it is implemented (there is little depth anyway, and the framerate divebombs). No stereoscopic 3D doesn't hurt the experience at all, though, even for someone like me who loves when it is used."

One thing which I'm delighted that Game Freak has done to really combat the ""imperfections"" with the 3DS Hardware itself is switch between 2D Top-Down World Exploration and 3D Battle Scenes, something which won't make your battery run out as quickly as you'd want it to! The voice chat actually works, and works very well, I'm able to hold a voice chat uninterrupted for a good 10 minutes the 3 times I've tried it which links to the PSS system that integrates your Friends, Acquaintances and Passers By semlessly. Yes, the minigames are there and make a joyous return to the series which also helps boost your stats along the way but the way the game is set around France is magnificent.

Having played for 6 hours already, it's safe to say that the gameplay is long, I've only got 1 gamebadge though that could probably be down to the fact I'm more of a ""Gotta Catch Em' All"" trainer rather than the speedrunning type!"
