Introduce formaa regionales de Pokemon ya conocidos, lo cual es un acierto, y cambia los gimnasios por pruebas y Pokemon dominantes, lo cual es un buen intento por cambiar el enfoque de siempre aunque no me ha terminado de convencer. A nivel artístico y tecnico está bien, aunque no destaca. La principal pega que le veo es que tiene un diseño y una historia extremadamente infantiles para mi gusto. Si te gusta la saga recomendaría darle una oportunidad aunque solo sea por ver un nuevo enfoque."

It's slow, boring, filled to the brim with boring-ass dialogue that makes up like 30% of the game, the most boring Pokemon fights ever and a mostly forgettable soundtrack (although a few songs are good).
Not a half bad Pokemon lineup, a few good songs, and the concept of the Ultra Beasts is cool. Those were all the positives.

  ",10,"SuMo is one of my favorite Pokemon games of all time. After 20 years Pokemon finally changed their formula. There are many quality of life improvements, as well as bigger changes such as the replacement of gyms for the island challenge. More importantly than that, though, is the massive narrative shift from previous Pokemon games.

The plot really takes center stage in SuMo (and later USUM), rather than it being just another factor on our journey to championship as it has been in most previous Pokemon games. The plot is interesting, the *characters* are interesting. It's no longer a story of you and your lackeys who sometimes hassle you for Pokemon battles at random points in the game - it's now a story of you and your friends. Your companions and rivals are crucial to the story - they're characters with motivations and backstories and personalities and development the likes of which have never been done in a Pokemon game before or after. You can sympathize with almost every character.

The game takes a much darker tonal shift in comparison to previous games. There's themes of abuse and manipulation, mind control and possession, there are scenes that I found genuinely disturbing at 17 years old."

Pokémon Moon will take its player to the flourishing Alola region, where upbeat, exotic tunes beautifully clash with more boisterous, violent electronic pieces, just as the game's tropical, traditional tribal setting clashes with the futuristic, sci-fi elements of its plot. Speaking of narrative, unlike XY, Pokémon Moon actually offers one of the best storylines in the series, more intimate than usual as it focuses on the struggles of a troubled family and the more marginalized members of society, with simple but endearing, well crafted character development. Sadly, this focus on the story frequently comes at the expense of exploration, halted and steered by narrative developments annoyingly often. Generally speaking exploration is one of the game's worst aspects, because as much as the locations are gorgeous and full of charm, the Level Design is for the most part dull and linear with laughably easy puzzles. In gameplay, Pokémon Moon introduces a new battle gimmick, Z Moves. These are mechanically way more significant than Megavolutions as they aren't exclusive of only some creatures, but they're just as frivolous and inconsequential since they provide very little change to the fun but extremely repetitive core battle gameplay. Fortunately, even if the challenge is generally tame, it can be surprisingly demanding with certain bosses, requiring great flexibility and strategy. On top of this, the Pokémon petting and customization features from XY make a return, greatly enhancing immersion."

While too easy for a lot of us, it introduced a lot of brand new stuff to the franchise with a fresh new story with interesting characters and villians (Which ultra later got rid of cause lmao).

The story is actually engaging, there may be too many cutscenes for some but I for one loved the more story focused experience of Moon.
Z moves are not as good as Mega Evolutions but they are alright.
The island challenge was a good change of pace from the gym system (even though I love the gym system)
The game wasn’t a total cakewalk, obviously not super difficult because it’s Pokémon but it’s definitely not X and Y easy
Hau and Lillie make for friendly rivals that actually work (unlike the horrible rivals in X and Y)

And if that is not enough, the game has one of the best post-games, with stuff like the return of Blue and Red, the hunt for the ultrabeasts and the introduction of bottlecas that finally give you a way around IV breeding(would still prefer for them to get rid of IVs entirely, but at this point, I take what I can get)."

It's amazing to see how FINALLY they innovated a bit and tried to change the formula, I know it doesn't change a lot, but change the necessary and it feels so fresh. Hope Sword and Shield do something similar and tries new things too.

Pokémon Sun and Moon also has the BEST STORY in a Pokémon game ever. Black and White had good ideas, sometimes poorly executed, but Sun and Moon worked so well, developed the characters and even made some plot twists. The relationship between characters, background stories and family bonds is the best we saw in a Pokémon game so far, the mixing of every single topic the franchise has touched was excellent!

And we can't forget about the difficulty, USUM made it harder, but Sun & Moon has some challenges with Totem Pokémon and a great Pokémon League, and well, we have even the Battle Tree, as the biggest postgame challenge we had since Emerald. Pokémon designs were excellent in this generation too!

New Alolan forms are cute, bring something interesting to the table, and expand on a pre-existing concept of regional variants. The music is lively and fits the island vibe. I enjoyed the changes to the battle UI, and hope they keep the type effectiveness notes moving forward.

Largely, for me, this generation was 2 steps forward, and 3 gigantic leaps backward.

I have played every Pokemon game since Red and Blue. The departure from concepts that built the core of Pokemon games since the beginning, namely gyms, will have longtime fans wondering why GameFreak thought the Orange Island story arc in the anime deserved to be featured front and center.

The region layout is lackluster and convoluted all at once. The ending drags on and on, and having no love for the characters established, I just wanted to scream after 20+ minutes of dialogue I didn't care about in the slightest. I had to force myself to even get through the main game. It simply was not fun or enjoyable for me.

I have never been so disappointed in a Pokemon game. I thought Black and White was pretty weak, but this is a new low. Let's hope Game Freak learns from their mistakes and returns to form with Sword and Shield."

However, the pros end there. For being an RPG Pokémon Moon feel VERY linear. The tutorial feels like it will never end and there is little incentive to stop and roam around the place. The storyline is way more interesting than older entries in the series but the abundance of cut-scenes make it feel slow at times.

The difficulty is non-existent until the last hours of the main content. The EXP SHARE makes leveling up your Pokémon a breeze and turning it off makes the game way more challenging.

I'm a fan since Pokemon Red and Blue came out in the U.S. in the late 90s but even after so long and having played all games I keep the assertion above: I was shocked with how much of a breath of fresh air this pair brought to the franchise. From replacing the gyms with a new boss system to new concepts like the rides, playing them feels like a mix of discovering so much new mixed with the prime pokemon trainer experience, not only many changes happened: They WORKED and they MATTERED which is something rare to say for games that change so much on old formulas.

The side content is some of the best the series ever had, the hunt for Zygarde cells, Pokepelago, Refresh, etc, you feel like the pokemon is your pal instead of just a sprite in the team screen

It has the best characters and best and most interesting story in the series, I'm yet to find a single pokemon fan who haven't gushed about how interesting and engaging the plot surrounding your journey was this time. Also decent pacing throughout your journey as to let you explore each section as the trials come by. The story actually managing to pull iconic and emotional moments like I've never seen in the series. And don't let the bright tropical looks and colorful people full  of personality trick you: the story can get dark at points, with uncharted themes to pokemon

The designs of new pokemon were ALL unique. You can feel a higher focus in creativity in each new pokemon, with ideas that feel iconic yet unexpected, including the regional forms, which bring new life to old pokemon like Raichu by putting them into new concepts based on how they'd adapt into a tropical setting.

Team Skull is the best ""evil team"" pokemon has had and will be remembered fondly 20 years from now as one of the highest points in the series (but I can say that about a lot of things Alola region brought us)

Z-Crystals are a neat way to make a weaker mon stay relevant, while working to all pokemon and having special effects if you combine it with effect/status moves. Speaking of the Meta, it's really well balanced in recent years, making going online a joy.

All accounted, don't let online trolls who diss nintendo games everywhere convince you otherwise: It is a Must to play this game or the Ultras if you enjoy pokemon, as any longtime fan ( of which many I have befriended by playing it with) will most certainly tell you, this pair and its follow up are love letters to any pokemon fan, from the pleasure that it is to make runs in it, to how easy it is to breed, trains and battle online, to the beautiful and interesting places to explore, to even multiple references and old characters from every gen coming back."

The story is on pair with great franchises known for their great stories, trials, kahunas, totems and captains are all interesting concepts that bring more and better to the table. Evil teams were the best we ever had. Z-moves complemented the main battle system well and naturally, without overwhelming it but adding a new layer stil. Catching, breeding and training pokemon is easier and more practical while still compelling to do, even going as far as giving a way to interact with the boxed pokemon in island where they can hang out, explore and even train.

The new pokemon in this game also relate to the setting of the game, but are still unique, and there are a lot less lazy designs than in other pokemon games. However, the story is just a run of the mill pokemon story (which is a good or bad thing depending on who you ask), and the replacement of gyms in place of the challenges was a change that I didn't like that much, honestly.

  ",4,"Pokemon Sun/Moon are by far the worst in the mainline series.
Pros:
--Bottle Cap system to allow pseudo-IV maxing
--The ability to send Pokemon from your party to the PC when catching other Pokemon
--Simple and effective egg hatching route (in the sense that this time it's just a square)
--Shiny Charm now only requires the regional dex to be completed
--Battle Tree
--The Mini islands where you plant berries, EV train, etc are a cool idea

Cons:
--Excessive amount of cutscenes, to the point where nearly every route has at least one cutscene (and the intro itself takes 12 minutes for a speedrunner to complete, far far longer for the average player)
--Excessive levels of handholding, I'm aware the series is for kids but the past games didn't have this much handholding
--Super easy, even for a Pokemon game. Not once did I have to repeat a battle and I finished the Elite Four first try with a slightly underleveled party.
--Extreme linearity, even for a Pokemon game, with tons of very obvious and shoehorned route and entrance blocks nearly every screen
--The majority of the new Pokemon designs are not very memorable nor are they very coherently designed, though this is a more subjective con I know I am not the only one who thinks this, and don't even get me started on Ultra Beasts
--No Super Training, despite both past games having them and it being a very well-received mechanic
--Mega Forms are more or less shoehorned into a place and it's clear they never really planned to have them back
--Z Moves are broken and ruin battles, and are required in every battle just like Mega Forms used to be
--The region is very bland, small, and not very varied between islands, it's clear Gamefreak had no idea what to do without the grid system
--Certain Pokemon have a 1% appearance rate in areas and that is just stupid
--Postgame is near non-existent, which makes the small and crappy region feel all the worse
--Nearly all the new Pokemon have tank-based stats, making party building unnecessarily difficult unless you want a full high defense, low speed team
--The Trials are a poor  replacement for Gyms, if anything both could have been done, there's not even 8 Trials
--The minigame theme park is not well-developed and does not reach its full potential

Gamefreak attempted to shake up the series with Sun/Moon. But change is not always good. Bad change is possible. And most of the changes in Sun/Moon are bad for the series. After how bad these games were I am outright skipping Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon and may not ever buy a Pokemon game again unless the 2018 game stirs away from the type of game these ones are, and this is coming from the person who has bought and completed generations 1-6 of Pokemon before these ones."

  ",8,"I don't think I've ever played a main Pokemon game that I didn't like.  My time with Pokemon Moon was a well spent one! There were some qualms, but I don't think they damage my liking too much.

Story: 7/10. As many have said before me, the story is not the best. To me, it definitely has more of an impact than that of Platinum or Soul Silver, but not as deep as ORAS or BW/2. So it's sort of in between good and bad, but more on the good, because I did enjoy it at the time but I can't see myself playing SM again for it for a while (I play for stories/characters, not competition).

Characters: 8/10. I think this is the charm of the game. I found the antagonists to have a nice balance of comedy and threat, the NPCs and their cute little easter egg references worth talking to, and the main/secondary characters charming enough to care for.

Battle System: 9/10. There's slight difficulty now and then, but not as difficult as Soul Silver or as easy as Pokemon XY! Aside from that, there's nothing much to complain about. It's the usual kind of turn based system as the previous games.

Graphics: 9/10. Although I was already satisfied with the graphics of XY and ORAS, I didn't mind the bigger change of SM too much! You can really see the details put into the backgrounds and characters, and because there is so much movement going around, the game feels very lively.

So yeah, this game was great in my opinion! I look forward to Ultra Sun and Moon."

  ",9,"This game is amazing, and not getting the scores it deserves in my opinion. It has the problem of starting a bit slow and with many cutscenes, which is maybe why it is getting low scores, the beginning of the game can be a bit tedious for veteran Pokémon fans. But this Alola region is amazing, beautiful, so full of joy and things to do, and from the third island things begin to improve drastically! It also becomes a lot harder from that point. I played without Exp. Share, without Z moves, and with Set Battle Style, and opponents began to overlevel my team even though I battled everyone. This made quite of the final battles of the game hard. So, it can be challenging if you want it to. Post-game is also quite decent, with many things to do, a few new routes, and the UB sidequest.

Something I didn't like that much is the SOS battle system. With Pokémon constantly asking for help, it can be pretty annoying to catch Pokémon, and also some exclusive Pokémon from this system are a pain to catch (I spent an hour looking for a Slowbro, and when it appeared I had lost so much focus I killed it with a crit; at least that was great because later in the chain I got a Shiny Slowpoke!). Another thing I have to point out is the frame drops against Totem Pokémon and when there are many Pokémon in the screen in older versiones of the Nintendo 3DS. While those situations aren't very common, they are a bit annoying. But apart from that I love the path these two games have taken. It has renewed the Pokémon franchise a lot, with things like Island Trials replacing gyms, which I believe are quite original and some of the Totem Pokémon quite challenging to beat. It also removed HMs, which allows you to train freely a team of 6 Pokémon! Speaking of Pokémon, I really like most of the Alola versions of Gen 1 Pokémon, most like Grimer were made a lot better, a lot more useful in-game than they ever were. And new Pokémon design is also very good, for me better than 6th Gen and 5th Gen Pokémon by a lot. The variety of Pokémon you find in Alola is huge, but they made it pretty well adding at least one or two of the new Pokémon to each of the new places to make the whole game feel fresh.

All in all, while not a perfect game, the game is still a very very good Pokémon game, it is being underrated due to its slow start, which maybe wants to help people new to the franchise understand Pokémon, but give it time, as it gets better the deeper you go in the game, and you can find challenge if you want to!"

Once I started playing this game, I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. It's even possible to catch most of the 1st gen pokemon. The best addition in this game is that you can defend the league as pokemon champions, and that's VERY COOL. Once I started playing this game, I couldn't put it down until I had finished it.

  ",9,"Pokemon has always been a staple of my childhood much like many of 90s kids growing in the U.S.. I was huge in the game up to Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, but as the new DS handheld came with Pokemon coming on there (along with my love for games on my Xbox 360 and growing up much more by the 2000s) I just sort of gave up on it at first. As X and Y released and I saw the newer Pokemon designs, I was convinced the franchise had hit a creative barrier and really showing fatigue. As I got my 3DS for the remastered versions of Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby (and enjoyed the hell out of it), I convinced myself to try the new Sun and/or Moon to see how it goes. I couldn't have been happier.

The game wonderfully captures my childhood love for the series and manages to create unique Pokemon despite the amount being far less than the originals. The story is surprisingly decent (and that's saying something for a Pokemon game) and I even got a bit emotional near the end after I beat the Elite Four. For a handheld, the graphics are pretty good in the game and fully utilizes 3D models and sprites that show such a evolution of Pokemon games. The combat and the inclusion of Z-Moves is amazing and allow more combat variety and techniques for players when engaging in battles of any kind. The music is goofy to even kind of cool though it can loop a bit often for my taste.

I love Team Skull in terms of humor. In fact, alot of the ways the game cracked me up by its dialogue. Its dialogue would easily fly over a child's head, but as an adult I got more than just the Disney-world ""everyone's happy"" vibe from the people. To put it simply, alot of Freudian concepts bleed through and if this was intentional of Game Freak to contain its adult fans, then they made it work. There is still cringe and wince worthy remarks though, but the moments of humor made me laugh so hard that I just played along with it.

My only main issues with Pokemon Moon (and Sun) is it can be brutal in terms of difficulty for younger kids when trying to combat the later game's trainers. Even I was struggling to just barely beating  them because I had a good team and just knew my types very well. Also the mini-games and some of the features (like grooming and such) is neat and cute, but to me pointless. I guess it's because I'm older and just was raised on playing it the original way huh? Pokemon Sun and Moon are great games that will give both new and old players (young and old) enjoyment and fun that Nintendo is able to draw on very well."

I was someone who was not a fan of last gens pokemon x and y and when I saw that this game was a ""refreshing"" take on the series I was very excited. Going in spoiler free I was enjoying my first 5-10 hours of gameplay. Seeing new pokemon, filling up my pokedex, and completing the games new trials system was fun. As the game goes on it has so many little things that annoy me that it just ruins my experience. The pokemon design and variety are some of the worst in the series, I thought x and y had a small new cast and thought for sure that this game would fix that but no, they made it somehow even worse. The new selection of pokemon is boring and uninspired, the story is asinine, the trainers are an absolute joke with even in the later half of the game 95% of trainers have 1-2 pokemon and are lvl 50 unevolved garbage. One of my biggest gripes is the difficulty. It is insultingly easy. The whole game feels like it is pandering to the new pokemon go fans between the difficulty and the constant Kanto references with the alolan forms and other mementos. I feel like with this game and the last 2 pokemon games the series is officially dead. Black and White 2 were the last good games and if this ""new take"" on the series is supposed to spice things up then I have little hope for future installments.

However, after taking a long break from Pokemon I have been pleasantly surprised by how much they have fixed with the game. EV and IV training is easy to do once you learn how. The changes to old gen pokemon are a nice twist. I only wish they did it with more of them. All of the new pokemon are fun and very few of them seem completely useless this time. The type balance this gen seems pretty good and the legendaries finally got properly banned like they should be except for a few game modes. The games have a proper story now as well.

My only gripe is the rampant outbreak of ultrabeasts and pseudo Legendaries who just outclass most pokemon. Those should be treated the same as legendaries when they aren't and kinda hurt the game balance in a PVP setting. Some of which are locked based on the version of the game you have. They also aren't breedable of which I wish they'd change."

  ",9,"Quite possibly the best version since the classic generations. Sun & Moon feels so fresh and new, taking gameplay to new heights. I remember the day I bought Pokémon Blue as a kid, this very moment changed my perspective on what games were capable of in terms of fun; Sun & Moon delivers quite similarly with amazing visuals, entertaining storylines, and a bunch of new Pokémon. S&M is also a lot easier to navigate, at the same time more challenging. Exploration is key in this new generation, as the map feels more alive and not so 'blocky' as in previous games. The only downsides here are some rather strange Pokémon designs and frequent cutscenes. Highly recommended to any Pokémon trainer!"

Los diseños de los Pokémon y escenarios están muy bien llevados en los gráficos, que explotan la 3DS. La banda sonora es de lo mejor visto en Pokémon, contando con remasterizaciones de la música antigua de la saga, a la vez que nuevos temas al nivel de otras entregas.

  ",9,"One of the best Pokémon experiences I've had and I've been playing Pokémon since Blue when I was 8 or 9 years old.
Turning off the Exp. Share is highly recommended to have a more challenging and enjoyable experience.
After skipping all the trailers and reveals to have a fresh adventure on Alola, along some low-expectations, as I knew there wouldn't be gyms and the game could be dumbed-down like OmegaRuby was, I was quite surprised when the experience happened to be fulfilling and the difficulty curve didn't disappoint (if you are playing with the Exp. Share off).

Having so many extras to make the competitive side of the game more enjoyable and less of a chore, this game presented a better experience than the one I had on BW and BW2 even though the story was simpler.
On the story side of the game, at first Lillie is a bidimensional character that says ""I don't want Pokémon to get hurt"" at least once per conversation, but in the end she get development as a character, unlike Hau.
Spending time in-game was fun, it took me about 15 hours to complete each island, stopping the main story for  while to catch and train Pokémon, finding hidden items and talking to the NPCs. I beat the Elite 4 on my first try after the 100 hour mark, while some other players finished the game in less than 30 hours.

Give it a try and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did."

The addition of ride pokemon is awesome, though I wish any pokemon that's big enough for you to ride on could be a ride pokemon, but still cool none the less. Alolan forms are great but their are too little, like literally only 15 COME ON. And no new megas is a bummer, they seemed to be replaced by z moves, which are cool to look at but megas are way better, and their answer to this is that it's bad for the pokemon. Really? also the new SOS battles where the pokemon call for help can get annoying especially if your trying to catch a pokemon. may seem like a lot of negatives, but it's a pokemon game with new pokemon, and still feels like a pokemon game so I do recommend I just got a lot of nitpicks"

  ",4,"This really doesn't feel like a mainline Pokemon game. At all. I was extremely disappointed with the approach they took for this game. Taking out gym battles and replacing them with ""trials"" or ""Island Challenges"" to fit the aesthetic of a Hawaiian setting. I honestly didn't mind the Hawaiian setting, i liked it at first, but then i realized that the entire core game's features revolve around that and it doesn't feel like a Pokemon game anymore. If this game was considered a ""Spin-off"" id be a whole lot easier on it in terms of scoring it. I'm all for change in video games, but keep the core features (Gym battles, Region-wide exploring in this case) and add to it, don't take it out completely. As a main Pokemon game part of the main series, it's a massive disappointment."

  ",7,"As a fan who has followed Pokemon for the full 20 years, Sun and Moon are mixed if not frustrating **** world building, characterizations, and unique culture found in the Alola Region are A+, and it all comes with a beautiful presentation that greatly surpasses Pokemon's first step into 3D. But in terms of gameplay, this installment, by and large, is not a strong successor to its predecessors at all in my humble opinion. There are a number of nice, small things that it gets right in this regard, but it also takes huge steps backward for reasons that I just cannot comprehend. Several features were either removed or made worse than what they were in previous games, and it leaves this Anniversary title feeling somewhat empty and unsatisfying once the main adventure is over and that 'New!' smell wears off.

If you want Pokemon to be a more story intensive series, or if all you’re invested in is a good run through the campaign, then this game will probably tickle your fancy. At the same time, if you like to go into the deeper game mechanics and enjoy after-game activities, I would advise treading with caution. This isn’t a bad game, but it's not at all the greatest that Pokemon has to offer.

Positives ~
- The world is well conceived, [mostly] well-written, and comes with a-lot of charm.
- The game in general is gorgeously presented.
- Ride Pokemon replace the need for HMs.
- Farming Berries, EVs, and treasure through Poke-Pelago is a nice luxury to have whenever I’m busy with studies or business.
- Pokemon Refresh is a pleasant successor to Amie.
- Small Quality of Life changes, such as making the ‘Judge’/IV Checker a feature of the Box, or asking if you want to swap a newly caught Pokemon into a full party.
- Choosing to break the mold of the Gym structure with the Island Trials as a new form of game progression.

Negatives ~
- The early game, even after 20 years, still insists that everyone playing Pokemon is a child who needs to be taught how to play. With no option to object or say ‘I know what I’m doing’. It can be intrusive.

- XY’s Player Search System is gone, leaving the game’s core multiplayer/online services slower and significantly less intuitive. In its place is the Festival Plaza, an online hub that you'll be logging into and out of regularly if you want to do anything related to Wi-Fi. Its a downgrade from being able to play the regular game and stay online at the same time.

- The DexNav, which allowed you to keep track of captured Pokemon in a given area (and actively search for them in the wild nearby), is gone.

- Friend Safari, which made Hidden Abilities, version exclusive Pokemon, starter Pokemon and even high IVs more readily available, is gone.

- Super Training and Reset Bags are gone, so stat management isn't quite as effective.

- The National Poke-Dex is gone after being built into every game since FRLG, and will instead be a feature of the Pokemon Bank...A paid service...

- There’s only one fishing rod now, and Magikarp has a higher encounter rate than everything (and no, that wasn’t a joke…I wish it was...).

- Triple Battles, Horde Battles, Rotation Battles, and Inverse Battles are all gone.

- The Frame-rate dip during Double Battles and Battle Royal is positively dreadful…

- The Rotom Map that regularly appears on the touch screen makes bare minimum use of it when compared to previous DS/3DS entries.

- The services available through the Festival Plaza hub are a poor follow-up to the Join Avenue. It features a series of shops that you can use in a similar fashion, but you can no longer pick what shops you want, and they won’t level up as they’re continually used and visited. You receive shops at random as you earn more Festival Coins for completing online missions, and you use those coins as a secondary currency to purchase stores from other players that you meet online…It’s...Kind of convoluted by comparison."

I really like how if you had a high affection with your Pokemon they could remove poison, paralysis, etc. out of sheer will because they don't want you to worry.  Very very nice touch.
There are tons of things to do during and after you finish the main story. New people to meet, new Pokemon to encounter.    The battle system was fun and in depth.  You really have to pay attention to the Pokemon you have, the abilities you use, and what consumables you carry and when to use them.

The story was good, with some nice hidden stories and dots to connect if you really pay attention.  Love the Lillie character, I would root for her any day.

The animation for Z-moves and just regular moves were well done.  Along with your Pokemon reaction when you feed and pet them.  I really love the game with very few complaints.  And with over 170 **** it shows lol.  Well, back to playing, cause you know ""Gotta Catch Them All"" :)"

The post game isn't as empty as X and Y. The story in the game is definitely better than most of the Pokemon games. I feel that one of the best things they did in this game is the removal of gyms. Having the island kahunas and trials rather than gyms made the game fit more with the overall environment in the game. It felt like a breath of fresh air after so many games that just followed the same old formula. Post game, you have a couple legendaries, Ultra Beasts, and Battle Tree, where you can meet characters from older games. My only issue with this game is that it runs like crap when there's more than 2 Pokemons out on the older 3DS. The frame rate drops to what would be considered unplayable if the game wasn't turn based. Other than that, this game is probably my second favorite Pokemon game right after Emerald. The big thing that Emerald did better than this game in my opinion, is how much post game content was in Emerald. This game definitely has a good amount, but it's nowhere close to Emerald's Battle Frontier."

The amount of times I was excited to come across a new route to find Pelipers and other older pokemon as well, I would have much prefered it if it was like Black and White where only new pokemon could be find until completing the main game.

  ",8,"I want to start off by saying I think this game is great. I'm starting off with the negative things, not to complain, but to get it all out of the way and end on a high note. Some of these complaints may be nitpicky, but they don't ruin the game for me so I think they're fair.

- Since there are no HM's (that's a plus, by the way) your substitute is Pokemon you can ride and use in other ways, like the Tauros you can ride and the Rotom that you have as a Pokedex, and I suppose an all-purpose utility object (a Swiss Rotom?). My only gripe about this is, and again I know it's small, but, why not just give us the Pokemon? I mean, we clearly have them, so why not add them to our Pokedex and maybe let us use them in battle? It isn't a huge deal, but still, it is kind of a tease.

- This game feels far more linear than previous entries and there's less exploring than in previous games. Funny, I've noticed Pokemon games becoming more and more linear with each passing generation, despite the advance in technology.

- Too many cutscenes and tutorials. I think that's the same thing that ruin the Mario and Luigi games for me.

- We're not stupid, the kahunas are gym leaders. I still think the game would be better without them and replaced with a different type of challenge. But, I like the way the lead up to the kahunas as opposed to just going into a gym and solving generic, easy puzzles or fighting a bunch of generic gym NPC's.

- We have another villainous team trying to steal Pokemon. We've seen that every generation. I don't think we need to see another villainous team in a Pokemon game. Unless there's a game where we get to be in the villainous team, in which case make another one for the next generation.

- There are quite a few Alolan forms that look absolutely atrocious.

- Pokemon's battle system is still a rock, paper, scissors type battle system, and I think that's what needed overhauled more than anything. Seriously, can we get an ATB style system like in Final Fantasy so the speed stat feels like it means more than just who goes first?

- Again, too many new legendaries were added, and they don't feel so legendary because of it.

- I swear Gumshoos is just Donald Trump.

Now for the things I liked:

- The trials. Like I said, they're a nice change from the generic gym setup.

- No HM's, so no HM slaves.

- The story is pretty decent. Not great, but it's okay.

- It only asks you once if you want your Pokemon to learn a new move instead of asking then asking to confirm it. Trust me, I love that change.

- I like quite a few of the new Pokemon, such as Toucannon (possibly my favorite design of all the new Pokemon), Mudbray, Araquanid, and Oranguru.

- I actually do like the designs of the islands, and the concept of them, even if they aren't large enough to give us much exploration.

Overall, I would give this game a 7.5/10 (showing as 8/10 because you always have to round up, right?). It is certainly overhyped. It's not the greatest Pokemon game, despite some critics calling it so. Silver and Gold still hold that place for me. But, I still think it's good. Maybe not the thing that will reinvigorate the Pokemon series, but it's a step in the right direction.

Hopefully the Pokemon Company will see changes are welcome and change a few things, overhaul the battle system. I think Nintendo could implement a few changes that don't just involve adding a new move to use in battle, or new forms in a way that isn't too complicated for younger players, but different enough to add a much needed deeper layer of game play and strategy to the games. Here's to hoping for bigger, better things in the future and that we see more changes and maybe a return to some old favorites, like the radio from Gold and Silver."

  ",8,"So... After months of anticipation, Pokemon Sun & Moon are finally out. Before Is start, I just want to mention that I have played these pokemon games since the very beginning. To this date, I have to say Pokemon emerald is still my all time favorite. It had exploration, wonder, two good enemy faction (magma and aqua) each with their own goals and reasons as to why they do what they do. On top of all that, they had a post game area called the battle frontier, essentially a set of mini-games with varying rules to challenge user.  I say this so you will understand where I am coming from in the review.

To start with, I enjoy the setting. You, the trainer, just moved to a new region called alola. Essentially, this region is not a giant map like every other game was. Instead, the region is made up of 4 small islands, each with their own pokemon (though some do cross over). I would assume they are trying to make this region similar to Hawaii, which I am fine with.

Another thing they did differently is they got rid of the gym system. Other games before this, you would enter a town, solve a problem usually caused by rival factions, then battle the gym leader, get the gym badge and repeat. This game instead makes you go through trails, which is like a sort of puzzle, before fighting a difficult pokemon, called a totem. I can see what they were going for, trying to break the mold. Though I don't hate it, it still feels foreign to me.

So here is something I find odd and kind of annoying. So my team is pretty powerful, some Pokemon are at level 30 (my traded Gengar is Lvl 44) and I assume I am 3/4 complete with the main story. I explore a new area and I lock eyes with a trainer. Im thinking ""alright, its go time. Show me what you got"". The battle starts and they only have a single Pokemon and I immediately go why... Most of the trainers you fight will only have 1 Pokemon, and rarely they might have two. I would like trainers to have at least 3-6 considering I am almost done with the main story. Battling trainers yields far more EXP than fighting regular mobs do, on top of that the more pokemon the enemy has, the more likely you are to see a pokemon you havent seen yet. Does anybody remember playing Pokemon Red? You just beat brook and you go down a road to enter a small cave. On the way there, there is a small cluster of NPC's each with their own pokemon, most of the time at least 2-3. By the halfway point in the game, most NPC's have at least 4-6 Pokemon. However it seems in Moon(the version I got) Almost every NPC has only 1 pokemon, which I can still usually one-shot if I want to.

Another thing abut this game I find odd. Say you are trying to catch a pokemon in tall grass. You slowly diddle its health down and even manage to paralyze it. All of a sudden, just as youre about to catch it, it calls for help. Every time the pokemon calls help, if it succeeds it brings another pokemon by the same name into the fight. Now you're sitting in a 1v2 fight, and are unable to throw any pokeballs out. So now you have to go back and forth and knock out the pokemon it calls for help, only to have it repeat the process over and over again. I wish I was joking, but I have been caught in a 10-15 minute look of this, all because I wanted to catch a beldum. It wouldn't even be so bad if the frames didn't lag during double battles.

One last thing I would like to mention. This game has a lot of text. Youre traveling through a town and its like a tutorial, they drag you into every store and side shop and talk to you. You probably dont care, you just want to catch pokemon, you dont want to take pictures and waste your time. But the game feels that you need to. Another things I have to say is that the rival faction (skulls) are seemingly lackluster. Granted I havent beaten the game just yet(almost there though), but it just seems to me like its a watered down version of team rocket, steal pokemon, get money. Except they dont have the same humor as team rocket, instead they use ghetto slang and hand guesters(like gangsters). After at least 10 hours of playing(I am guessing) I dont understand their motives or their goals. Team Aqua and Magma wanted to use the legendary pokemon to either cover the world in water(Aqua) or land(magma). Team Plasma wanted to free all pokemon by force. Team Flare wanted to destroy the ENTIRE planet. Team Skull just want to be a minor nuisance to everyone around them.

As a whole, I enjoy the game, especially because I have a bunch of friends that play it as well. Its Pokemon, and it has survived as a franchise for nearly 2 decades doing the same thing over and over very well. Its a collect-athon of the highest order.  Collect pokemon, evolve them, capture other pokemon, become the best trainer of them all, and fill out the pokedex. If you liked the core aspect of pokemon, you will enjoy this game, just set your text speed to the fastest speed and grab your ultra balls and start collecting."

Here's what's wrong with the game:

The amount of hand-holding and linearity is absurd. There's no way you can even turn off tutorials or the constant directions, the best you can do is set your text speed to fast and mash A. You can tell they went above and beyond to try to make this game as child friendly as possible. Unfortunately, in doing so, they've alienated their teenage and adult consumer base.

I don't care about the lack of gyms, to be honest, I was never really a fan of them to begin with.  The rest of the experience is generally what you'd expect from a pokemon game. There are some new innovations, like the lack of HMs, but I feel as if they're overshadowed by the aforementioned hand holding and linearity."

  ",5,"Pokémon Sun and Moon are worth the price, just not quite as good as the hype. To be honest I was somewhat disappointed but I do think the game is worth the price. I've been playing since blue originally came out so I'd like to say I've been for quite a while. This game has a lot of hit and misses. I don't think this will be the game to revolutionize Pokémon completely but it does take some steps in the right direction which makes me excited for future instalments. This game did feel unfinished but I wonder if that's because of the rumored new game for the switch.

The story is relatively boring until it does a 180 and escalates really quickly. It feels like it takes age for something worthwhile to happen. When it does it's over almost as soon as it starts. Most if not all the story revolves around the character Lillie. So much of the story revolves around her and ""Nebby"" that you almost the main character by proxy only. Lillie's constant inability to do anything for herself did sort of get on my nerves. Even when she ""changed"" it felt like the majority of that was her wearing different clothes and remind us how different she is now. However, she still refused to use Pokémon, become a trainer, etc. She still relies on you to do everything until the very end when she leaves to Kanto. Gladion could have been removed from the story and it would have been almost 100% the same. He only really felt like a vector to shoehorn in type: Null"

  ",3,"Pokémon Moon is one of those games that changes the face of a successful franchise in a bad way. Although it is a very fresh and innovative Pokémon game in the saga, it lost all hope when the developers took the most important part, Pokémon Gyms, out of the game. Without any badges to get, this tedious adventure lasts more than 30 hours with the least favorite story of the series. The designs of the Pokémon and scenarios are very wacky, strange, and ****, and the graphics look alright and decent. The soundtrack is the worst of the Pokémon series, terribly depending on versions and sounds of other regions. What a disgrace. Without a doubt, the worst game in the Pokémon franchise."

  ",2,"I'll keep this review updated as I go but this is the most unplayable DAY 1 release I've ever witnessed and I've been buying Pokemon games on release day since red and blue back in the 90s. And despite being an oldie - I am definitely not the type to hate new changes. I loved ORAS and XY and B2W2 (XY had a small struggle because Nintendo completely bungled the Pokemon Bank release, but the game was still wonderful from day 1). The last time I was this infuriated by Pokemon was with the original Black and White when there was that annoying character following you around the whole game interrupting the flow of gameplay with inane button mashed scrolls of garbage small talk. However, this one is worse by far. It took 90 MINUTES of game play before I could even get to a Pokemon Center, save and discover that Pokemon Bank was unavailable (and sadly Pokemon bank is the least of my problems here). I had bred a level 1 Omanyte and Dunsparce in ORAS to try to make my first playthrough of Sun be more challenging (they tend to make each generation more and more idiot friendly - for example, taking away type-matching by giving players a cheat prompt now in Sun and Moon). Anyway, not being able to import my Pokemon was definitely a bummer and really inexcusable for Nintendo (they're like the lazy employee at a job) but still not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that even after 90 minutes of absolutely horrible intro-scene/tutorial patchwork, finally being able to get to the Pokemon center -- the intro-montage STILL isn't over! It's like they have gone out of their way to design a game that should have been titled ""BUTTON MASH MEANINGLESS SCROLLS OF GARBAGE: Pokemon themed edition"". Anyway. I'm super disappointed. I don't know how anyone is supposed to get into this story line with all this crap pulling you out of the game mentally. It feels like a chore to play this so far and it shouldn't feel like that after two hours. I should actually be able to play the game at this point."

  ",4,"I have been with the Pokémon franchise since Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and I must say, the main series have gotten better over years! It was not until X and Y where I thought Game Freak finally revolutionized the series with 3D models and big beautiful landscapes to the point of making it great to play again. They finally changed the game for the better! However, it was not until I played Sun and Moon, where, overall, the games have changed the formula of the series in such a dramatic way, that it was not the way I was hoping for Generation 7 to turn out to be. With that being said, I have listed the pros, where the games did well on, and the cons, where the games did poorly on.

Pros

+ The new forms for some of the Pokémon are fun to use

+ The Festival Plaza is pretty entertaining and a good way to get items

+ You're now able to heal status ailments by taking care of your Pokémon after battle

+ HMs are replaced with the more efficient Pokémon Pager system

+ Trials and Kahunas provide an interesting twist to the standard gym battle formula

+ The graphical upgrades make trainers and Pokémon look better and more interesting

+ Ability effectiveness now appears on the move select screen

+ A map on the bottom screen shows where you're at and where your next objective lies can be pretty helpful

+ Battle mechanics offer a new and fun touch

+ Does experimental things with formula

+ Riding Pokémon lifts the move limitations throughout your adventure

Cons

- Daycare only breeds eggs and no longer levels Pokémon

- Very few Pokémon in game and no Pokémon Bank until January

- Serious frame rate drops during totem battles and double battles

- A lot of unnecessary cut scenes slow down the game. (I love cuts scenes normally but some of them feel pointless. There are quite a few cut scents that comprise of people only waving at you.)

- No room to explore freely until almost the third island, everything is extremely linear

- Alola Pokémon seem to have a low encounter rate

- Not a lot of variation in Pokémon. Many places just have the same Pokémon with one new Pokémon added into the mix

- Your dialogue choices almost have no impact what so ever

- Your character's expression almost never changes which is a bit jarring when other characters are
visible upset.

- Double Battles chug rather harshly

- More linear and easy going

- Story less intriguing than expected and, at times, can be nonsensical and uninteresting

- Z-move animations are way too long can and be boring to watch after several times

From an overall standpoint, Pokémon Sun and Moon had many great points about it. However, the big changes to it feel as if Game Freak is trying to reboot the Pokémon series, even though it is already great. Instead of these big changes, why not just keep the gyms and add more Post-Game content to the new games? Taking pictures of Pokémon, challenges and trials from different characters, and fun minigames all feel like optional activities that you could do by yourself, but you are forced to do them in Pokémon Sun and Moon. Because of this, I did not enjoy the game, and I felt like they changed too much to the new generation. The game has its great and beautiful moments, but it also has it tedious and monotonous moments as well.

* Now remember this clearly. This is just my opinion. Please do not feel offended by it. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you have a wonderful day!*"

The cast and characters are well done, the battle system is fun as well as the animations of the trainers. This is not a simple reskin of X and Y this is a whole new adventure with new mechanics and new pokemon. I am honestly excited to write this review and go back to playing the game."

  ",5,A mediocre expansion to the Pokémon universe. If you enjoy stupid gimmicks like mega evolution then you might love this but Sun and Moon have very little improvement on the tried and true formula and do a lot of hand holding.

  ",9,"Pokémon Luna es uno de esos juegos que solo pasan una vez en la vida. Un juego de pokémon muy fresco e innovador en la saga. Sin medallas que conseguir, esta maravillosa aventura dura más de 30 horas contando con la segunda mejor historia de la saga. Los diseños de los pokémon y escenarios están muy bien llevados y los gráficos explotan la 3ds. La banda sonora es la mejor vista en pokémon contando con versiones y sonidos de otras regiones remasterizados para que se adapten a Alola.
Sin duda, de lo mejor del año."
