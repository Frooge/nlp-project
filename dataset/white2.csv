The region of Unova has been greatly updated creating one of the largest regions in the series. There are so many areas to explore and every new area feels fresh and exciting. The Pokemon distribution in this game has improved from the originals. There is a fantastic spread of Pokemon with new and old ones being found all over the place; you can now adventure through Unova with your favourites from the entire series. Overall, I view this game as the pinnacle of Pokemon, and is a worthy investment whether you are new to the series or a veteran to it. This is certainly a 10 out of 10 Pokemon experience."

  ",10,"Ever since I first picked up Pokémon Pearl as my first Pokémon game ever, I'd fallen in love with the series. While I do admit Black and White 1 were kind of a let down compared to the rest of the series, I simply cannot say the same for Black and White 2. Let's face it, the Unova region was a line in the first  versions. However, in Black and White 2, the Unova region has more twists and turns and routes while still clinging to its hexagonal roots. Hidden Grottoes were a way more fun way to get hidden ability pokemon compared to the somewhat tedious act of having to transfer them from your computer. Join Avenue was a really cool addition seeing that you could customize your shops to your liking. The key system is awesome seeing that you could either up the challenge or lower it. The story is very interesting seeing that it's a direct sequel to Black and White 1 and while you don't need to have played the first ones to understand the story, you'd certainly get more out of it. The Unova region finally has obtainable pokemon from other generations before the Pokémon League, something its predecessors lacked. And while I could go on listing things I like about for a while, let's get to what they got wrong. Honestly there isn't much they got wrong this time around. Other than the still stupid AI even in Challenge mode, and the return of the infamous C-Gear, there isn't anything really I have to complain about; except Garbordor. You really messed up there. While it still clings to its roots and the title alone seems like it'll be a rip off, you'll find something in here that you love, whether you're returning from Black and White or just starting out. It isn't perfect, but it's sure a rerun worth more than what you'd paid for it. I give this game a 9.5/10."

  ",8,"They would have to try really hard to make a bad game in the Pokemon main series. I have played every single iteration of the game, and it never gets old. Which is surprising, given that the storyline is pretty much always the same (small town kid becomes Pokemon champion while thwarting the plans of a criminal organization). It would be cool to get some insane twist on this formula, but alas, we'll have to wait at least until the next generation for that.

What pushes Pokemon White Version 2 ahead is that it is, arguably, the best sequel to an original Pokemon game released thus far. That's because, for the first time, it actually succeeds in feeling like a sequel. You can synchronize it with your White or Black Version 1 games so that the events in your previous adventure are actually remembered by the people here, and that's very cool.

Other than that, it's the same Pokemon action we all know and love, and that means hours and hours of light-hearted fun."

I managed to get through White but couldn't bring myself to go another lap around the Pokemon White track. Now I've faced my biggest challenge of all, Pokemon White Version 2... I had my doubts when I bought the game and to be honest I shouldn't have tried it but I made that mistake and I can honestly say that this was Terrible. Pokemon is about being able to like your pokemon and be happy and a little proud at how well you're little guys are doing, this game made me want to drown each and every one of the ugly critters. What happened to pokemon that looked cool or cute? Now we have pokemon that are just blobs stuck together and make pained gargling sounds.
The new Rival system that seems to have come about is tedious as I don't feel the need to beat them like I once did, Oaks grandson thought he was the sun and we all revolved around him, I played that game not to be the best trainer but to knock him from his high horse. When I played Silver my rival was a crook who I was determined to show the error of his ways, even Ruby, which had your rival as a friend was great as it felt fresh and like a new direction. Now we receive the same back story almost like the developers are scared of inter human violence! The game is about animal beating the stuffing out of each other for crying out loud! There are many issues that I have with this game but the bottom line is that I find it unplayable. I am not interested in the pokemon or the characters and I couldn't care less if the Unova region sank into the sea. The thing I realised from this game is that 'Just because you have millions of ideas, doesn't mean you need to show them all off as sometime it destroys what you already had'
Of course this is just my view on the game. I will always think that the Kento and Johto pokemon are the best."

Yes, yes. We get it. Read any review of any Pokemon game ever and you will hear much of the same thing.  It's just the same game. The same old formula, re-skinned and re-released to try and make more money. They're not just milking the cow dry but beating it with a stick.  And to that I have to agree.  In the newest installment, you won't find anything that re-invents the series. This game feels and plays just like all of the other Pokemon games.  that being said it should be easy to decide if this game is something worth your time or money on.  if you've liked Pokemon in the past, chances are you will like this game.  If you've never enjoyed them, this isn't going to change your mind.  What it does have, is enough new content and challenges for someone who has never missed an installment to enjoy, as well as give newcomers a fresh perspective of the series.

Right off the bat this game feels a little different.  It's not the exact cut and paste adventure that most of the games have become.  You start off in a larger city. A professor doesn't give you a Pokemon, her assistant does.  I realize that these are minor differences that wouldn't even be worth mentioning as a change in most game series, but it does make the game feel fresh.  The first big change comes fast, however.  The Pokemon you will find inhabiting the first few areas are not what you would expect.  Instead of a bird and some other rat or beaver from the current generation, you are confronted by all sorts of Pokemon spanning multiple generations.  I found myself feeling anxious every time I entered a battle, wondering what the next monster will be.  This is a feeling that, in my opinion, has not been felt by gamers since the first installment of the series.  Whenever you can capture a feeling like that for the first time in years, you have to give the developer props. After that the game continues on like you would expect it to.  Catching new companions, fighting gym leaders, being the good guy.  You've done this all before and the game does feel a little easy at times.  The story isn't going to grab you're interest either.  A new feature that seems to really make the game more enjoyable is the medal system.  Aka- achievements.  There are around 200 in game medals that as a player, gave me a reason to want to get to the end game faster.   As in most Pokemon games, a good deal of the game occurs after you become champion and defeat the elite four.  The battle subway makes a return, as does the Black City/White Forest from the last game.  These give players who want a challenge just that.  Only the most carefully bred and raised Pokemon will be able to beat the later levels of the subway.  Mix that with the ability to change the difficulty, a first ever for the series, and you won't be cruising through these parts.
Now I've saved the best for last, in my opinion.  The Pokemon World Tournament, or PWT, is a new feature of the game and one of the best ever introduced into the series.  You are able to enter a single elimination tournament with virtually every gym leader, elite four, and champion spanning all five generations.  Remember how great it felt to beat Giovanni back in the day? Want a chance to go up against Brock or Misty again? Their all here and man are they ready for a fight.  If you thought the battle subway was hard, you haven't seen anything.  The amount of strategies and thought required here trumps even the most in depth and complicated RPGs to date.  If you want a challenge, they given it to you.  Wrapping it up now, this is a good game.  It's slow at times and is, for the most part, the same game that you have played ten times before.  But if you're a fan of the series and want a challenge, there may not be a better Pokemon game for you.  9 out of 10"

I took the risk anyway and got this game and after beating it I have realized that this may very well be the best Pokemon game of the entire series. It had so many improvements and key features removed from previous games. The story was far better than expected, the Elite Four was a huge improvement from the last game, the gyms were far more interesting to go through, the rival is far more likable, and most of all the regions are all mixed together in this game. From the very beginning generation 1 Pokemon are able to be caught as well as 2-5. I have to say, I've played since Blue version and I never expected something this good."

  ",10,"Amazing game.   Franchise veterans will love the extremely polished mechanics like the simplification of nature breeding, better pacing, and achievement system (Medals).  Younger gamers and newcomers will find the presentation quite astonishing, especially for a DS title.  The 3D cut scenes are really cool and will blow you away.  Lots of replay value, beautiful in-game sprites, the World Tournament, the new Move Tutors, hidden burrows, incredible music, gym layouts, and many other simple tweaks like the sunlight blinding you when you come out of a building or cave make this game a perfect one in my eyes.  It is the ultimate realization of the Pokémon formula."

  ",10,"The recent release of Pocket Monsters Black Version 2 and Pocket Monsters White Version 2 in Japan was a pre-empted shock to those outside the world of Pokémon. Along with the summer arrival came the remorse (as its similarity to HeartGold and SoulSilver, themselves remakes, is striking) of the previous games. Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 are set two years after the fall of N and Team Plasma, with characters, concepts, and Pokémon never before seen. The story takes place at the same region, Unova, but with a different rival. Also, one of the rivals from the previous game, Cheren, is now a Gym Leader.

These games also have a new facility known as the Pokémon World Tournament. Not only does this feature allow players to battle every gym leader, as well as champion, from every region (with the exclusion of Koga), but it also changes the battle theme for each opponent they face, upgrading them from memories lost to memories regained, and transforms the game itself into a battle-field fit for all players of all genders and generations, making for a never-ending TRUE Pokémon battle between masters!"

  ",7,"I would love to give this game more than a 7, but sadly I just can't. The reason why is not because this isn't a solid RPG or its just an average game but its because Gamefreak continue to play it safe. Out of these 'Version 2's' I expected something more innovative, new and fresh. The game has a nice presentation style and graphics package for a DS game but the problem is with the same tried and tested formula which although is very solid for many fans others will be less satisfied. Sadly I'm one of those who are less satisfied which is dissapointing as this is a franchise I love. But above all else the same tried and tested formula doesn't excite me anymore. + If your a diehard fan of the franchise this game will still be a solid, and long enough experience
+ Nice presentation style for a DS game
+ RE-introduction of some staple mainstays.
- Not deviating enough from the formula of Black and White
+/- Same old Pokemon
In summary a solid game that has hours of content but never really reaches the levels of excitement and fun seen in previous Pokemon titles and feels a bit like a retread through Unova. Still worth a buy if you love Pokemon though."

  ",9,"Pokemon BW2 is an excellent game. With new characters, new music, new locations, ""new"" pokemon (pokemon from previous generations, unlike the Unova-specific preE4 roster from BW) and a new plot, it's quite fun. All locations have changed in some way or another, whether it's adding new buildings/gyms, to revamping cities, to completely new cities, and it's nice to see how it had developed over the two years (in addition, the cities and towns are the largest yet). Another neat thing to notice are the gyms - what they lost in complexity (which was a bit disappointing), they gained in originality and character. Each gym has its own exclusive track (from Elesa's fabulous ""Are you ready?"" electronic theme, to Burgh's cool, creepy (and by far my favorite) one)), and have great setup.

Gamefreak also added in tons of things to keep you busy, whether it's collecting the 200+ medals (the equivalent of achievements or trophies), to making movies in Pokestar studios, to playing Funfest Missions, challenging the towers in White Forest/Black City, and finally challenging the top trainers in the World Tournament. Of course, some of the features from BW return in this game, such as the Musical Contests and the Battle Subway.

Along with the large features, Pokemon BW2 really shines in the details. Tiny things, like sunbeams shining whenever you come out of a building, to moving NPC sprites (finally!), to the ""battle platforms"" for your Pokemon (simple coloured circles, be gone! Depending on your location, you can get grass gently blowing in the wind, to rippling waves, etc.) all add a sense of pleasure and detail to your playthrough that had never been seen before (at least, it does for me - I love small details like that). New Hidden Hollows, areas where you can catch Pokemon with their hidden abilities, are also a joy to discover.

There are a couple of downsides to BW2, however - first of all, because the selection of Pokemon at the beginning is so varied and, well, good, I found the playthrough to be a bit easy compared to previous games. I have not yet touched the Challenge Key, but that will hopefully solve the difficulty curve once I acquire it (still, the wide variety of Pokemon can offer you different gameplays, if you are one to plan your team ahead of time). Another thing that really bothered me was the dialogue and general plot progression. It's so incredibly clunky and badly written that I found myself wincing more than once (and even at one point believing that my game had miraculously become bootleg). As some people have mentioned, it isn't as 'fresh' as BW - but do you honestly expect it to be? Keep in mind, this is the equivalent of Platinum, or Emerald - it's leagues ahead of any Grey version we might have gotten, and all of the changes still ignite the feeling of exploration, albeit not as much (and please don't complain about there not being any new Pokemon - this is not a new generation!)

Still, this game is another incredibly fun romp through the land of Unova. The upsides greatly outweigh the downsides of this game, which are minuscule (with exception of that dialogue! What happened to you, translation team?) I fully recommend that you get it. Why not?"

  ",8,"A game that packs more punch than it would appear on the surface. For the first time in franchise's history, the traditional ""third version"" feels like an actual new adventure instead of the same experience repackaged. For starters, the dex got massively expanded - a whopping 150 Pokemon (more than ever before) were added to the Unova Pokedex, including fan-favourites such as Growlithe and Eevee. Picking your final 6 of such a massive collection is nothing short of a challenge, and greatly contributes to the series already excellent replayability. The way you progress through the map is also very different -  several new zones were added, and on top of that, each of the old zones got nicely redesigned, making them feel fresh. The game is also feels a bit less linear than BW - there are more caves, hidden secrets, more non-obligatory routes and places (like a haunted house). However, several problems, some of which were present in BW1, still remain unsolved. Musicals only ""advantage"" is that you're not forced to play them this time around. The hyped Pokemon World Tournament is frankly a poor man's Battle Frontier - no amount of fanservice is going to hide the fact that it's a compilation of easy, boring battles that any half-competent player will breeze through in 10 minutes tops. Online service is still mediocre at best - Dream World should only be played by total masochists, Random Match-ups are marred by disconnectors and cheaters, while Global trade station still allows for ridiculous things such as the famed lv.9 Reshiram (not legally obtainable by any means!). Despite this, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 remain a great addition to the DS collection, and a game that hopefully all future ""third versions"" will follow suit."
