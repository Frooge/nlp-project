  ",9,"This game is rather alienating to veterans of the series, I get it. It's weird to have a roster of 150 fresh Pokémon, and have some of them be superior overhauls of previous designs in the series, such as the mysterious Musharna over the disturbing Hypno, or the drill-headed Excadrill, a redesign of the bland (yet SOMEWHAT amusing) Dugtrio. It's weird to have Bug and Poison Types that are actually usable and aren't just Route 1 Pokémon. It's weird to give a Pokémon game an actual story with actual plot, and a deep message about not submitting to the way others think and how they want this world to run. It's weird to have a region with environmental diversity (Hoenn aside). It's weird that they wanted players to have a breath of fresh air in the Regional Pokédex and not have Pikachu shoved into their face for the 800th time. It's weird how TM's are actually usable now and you don't have to fear losing one forever.

This game is a gem and Sinnoh stans and genwunners should stop crying."

Yes the scenario is great, yes the musics are also great (just like in any other pokemon games) but the pokemon are forgettable and you will face only three of them until the 3th badge. When I play pokemon I want to build a good team and then face challenging opponents, but in this one I just kept my starter and destroyed the 4 first arenas. Then I just stopped playing because I was bored. 5/10"

The only thing I didn't like is that the moral of the story is too straightforward. I would even say childishly sugary. Nevertheless, I look back at society nowadays and realize that many people do not understand even such basic morals, so we need such stories, that teaches us simple things."

Yes it has a great scenario, but the scenario is not the thing I want to be good in a Pokemon game. The new Pokemon are forgettable and there are not enough of them.

  ",8,"Pokemon White is one of the two main games of the fifth generation of the legendary Pokemon games franchise (the other being Pokemon Black). It was released in 2011. The game follows the tried and true recipe of a Pokemon game. This time you travel around the Unova region, apparently based on the greater New York area. You get a great story, fighting the mysterious Team Plasma, having fun with your annoying friends and battling your way around the obligatory loop. There is a great deal of post-game content available after you beat the Elite Four for the first time. There is a weird level jump that might force you to grind paradoxically right after you beat the Elite Four. Otherwise it is top notch. The graphics is likeable. The difficulty is not great, but it can still get challenging at times. You do not meet Pokemon from other regions until you beat the Elite Four, which kinda ****, only because the fifth generation Pokemon are really ugly. Very personal opinion, of course. I played this game on PC using the DeSmuMe emulator. No microtransactions or SJW politics are present in this game.

Pokemon White is a very good game with interesting gym design and ugly Pokemon. Final Verdict: 82%"

It’s only N who’s interesting. The post game isn’t waaaay more interesting then other games? It’s the same formula as the other games. Elite 4, catch all Pokémon. This game is praised as being the best Pokémon game and ALL others released after it are “so beyond bad”. I beg to differ, this is the game that started the annoying trend in Pokémon games of characters non stop talking. The game that started the button mashing. Sun and Moon are the worst for non stop talking but this is where it started. This game also has next to no variety in Pokémon. Early game you’re so very limited for choice, end game you have more choice but it’s end game. Lame. This game also gave us the elemental monkey Pokémon so ew. 3/10."

  ",9,"Realistically this game probably isn't a 9 out of 10. It still falls into many of the pitfalls that the other pokemon games do. There's a lack of difficulty, simplified gameplay, and a lack of significant change when compared to the other games. However, I still love it. Beaten this game and Pokemon Black maybe 5 time combined and every time I enjoy it just as much. A surprising step forward for pokemon when it comes to storytelling, as this time it actually poses questions and ideas that encourage the player to think about the actions they are taking, even if it's still comparatively basic to other RPG stories. The sprite work and world design is at its best here, love the culture of Unova and its varied settings. I like how the gym leaders actually play a role in the world and in the story, with you often times working alongside them, instead of just doing a fetch quest for them or finding them in a random spot. Has some of my favorite music in the series, namely Ns theme, Driftveil, Nimbasa, and the Elite 4. Has it's flaws but I just like it too much not to rate it highly."

I  remember getting the game and beating it in a few weeks.  I needed my  brothers pokemon  to beat the final bosses.  The game can get hard  and  while some  people may  complain about the game being linear, I don't mind  because pokemon ruby and sapphire was  pretty much just as linear and no one complained.  However pokemon  white  2 has way more exploration.  I  also have to say that the post game isn't the best, it's  still  a better post game than some of the other previous  games.   One thing I also love is  that they unlocked the older pokemon  at the post game so that way I can  get acquainted with  them rather than  just use older pokemon.  Lastly this game is nostalgic  to me because I played  more of the game after I beat it during the time I graduated  high school.  There was ship I went  on  during that time  and then when I started playing the game again, I went on the ship and  it was  one of the most magical feelings  I got.  Especially with the music.

  ",8,"I remember playing Pokémon White when I was a child and having a hard time knowing why B/W even existed, but the more I grew, the more I noticed that Pokémon B/W are indeed the best games in the franchise even at this day.
Pokémon B/W succesfully tell the most mature plot in any Pokémon game, making a focus on character development and presenting a constant clash between truth and ideals, making this the reason of the names, different ways of seeing something, but more than dividing in Black and White, finding shades of gray between both. That made a huge impact on me when playing this game at this age.
Pokémon B/W shows different ways of growth and acceptance with our rivals, N, Bianca and Cheren, every one connected to the main character in one way or another, but at the same time, so unique and far away from our truth and ideals, each having their own. In this game, even characters like Gym Leaders are important, and the champion is arguably the best in any Pokémon game, helping our characters to grow and develop.
Pokémon B/W made a daring decision with its art style, making moving 2D sprites and taller more mature looking overworld, using sometimes 3D animation, something unbelievable taking into consideration Nintendo DS' hardware.
This game also introduced the most amount of new Pokémon, making team building feel fresh and unique, as if back on Red / Blue. A lot of people didn't like this, but in my opinion, it changed the way I played future titles, using only new Pokémon.
5th gen OSTs are, also, pretty good, and I've seen a lot of people who say the same, some even saying its one of the best Pokémon has seen ever, but I think this is totally subjective, even though I really like it, and say it's memorable.
If I had to say something I dislike, is mythical Pokémon encounters. B/W started a trend I actually dislike a lot, making these Pokémon gifts at the Pokémon center, something rarely seen in previous generations, where, for example, you could get Darkrai, Shaymin and other Pokémon in special areas made for them.
Overall, Pokémon Black and White, in my opinion, are the best games in the franchise, and I totally recommend giving them a shot, if possible."

  ",10,"When i first played Pokèmon White, it was an unforgetable time and i seriously had so much fun. Playing them again, they are still as good as i remember. The music is SO good and my favorite in the whole franchise, the character designs are fantastic, with highest quality waifus ever; Hilda, Skyla and Elesa. Both Hilda and Hilbert are the best avatars for the player in any Pokèmon, in my opinion of course.
Unova is a beautiful region made better with season changing. Unova`s routes are more linear now, but i can forgive it, cause they are expansive. Though Unova and its Routes does not match the glory of Hoenn, Sinnoh and their routes.
The new Pokèmon are like any other Generation for me. Some good, some that i truly love, some bad and some i hate, but only having new Pokèmon and placing older ones to post Elite Four made the games feel more fresh for me too and i loved it.
The sprites are amazing here too, i must say. The story is alot of fun and feels more significant. You can argue wheter its truly good or not, but i enjoyed it and thats all that matters. The post game once again allows me to explore new areas, which is all i ask for as post game for Pokèmon
For me, these games and their sequels are the definitive way to play Pokèmon. I could go on and on and on about how great these games are, but nah. I love them so much. Fun story, great music, wonderful region and a great new cast. White is my favorite Pokèmon game of all time.
Ill leave this review with an appeal:
Game Freak, please DO NOT REMAKE GENERATION 5!!! They are great enough as they are!!!"

  ",7,"Story is a main focus for this game. Pokemon had been adding more and more story to their games up to the release of Pokemon White Version and this game delivered one of the best stories yet. It challenges many things that you think about the Pokemon world and treats you more like a true hero than a kid playing a video game. Almost all of the new content to this game is memorable and fantastic, especially the season changing feature, where the seasons in game will change every few weeks. Pokemon White Version also had the cleanest graphics and art out of all of the 2D Pokemon games to compliment its variety of music, moods, and events.

The reason this game falls a bit short is mostly its ambitiousness not quite paying off. The quick connection feature is something you rarely use, that Game Freak seems to have put a lot of time into. It seems like they wanted to expand into an online oriented game before moving the series to 3DS, when they should have waited for their next main series game instead. The ""triple battles"" was something I was so excited for when the game first came out, but I'm not sure I ever even used it.

Most of what Game Freak did for this game, was a massive leap for the series, but they tried to do too much, too fast. The game is definitely an exciting and engaging one, but too many features were a let down."

  ",9,"Despite the fact that Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are my main childhood Pokemon games and the ones I have the most nostalgia for I definitely consider Pokemon Black & White to be my personal favourite games in the series.
I consider this game to be the last ""amazing"" game in the series as it pretty much did everything right, from its design to its music to its story to even it's aesthetic. The mix between 2D and 3D graphics actually brings an amazing amount of style to this game's visual approach as it allows for a lot more perspective and can actually create some of the best atmosphere in the series and it also prevents the game from ever looking dated. The music is extremely memorable and quite funky at times but also rather engaging to the point where it actually makes certain battles in the game a lot more epic and intense. The Pokedex for the Unova region is probably where the game can be considered weak in comparison to most of the Pokedex's that came before it however the fact that you can only capture the regional Pokemon until the post-game is actually a great addition as it allows you to build a more diverse team that actually ends up holding more sentimental value to you than you'd expect. But by far my favorite thing about this game is surprisingly enough its story and characters simply due to the fact that a Pokemon game has never directly gone as deep into it's story as Black and White has."

  ",9,"For fans of the old versions, there's a handful of new features in Black/White to embark on the adventure once more.

Similar to other pokemon games, the adventure is similar. Your adventure starts off in your home in a small town in the region of Unova. Soon after you will be given your choice of the starter pokemon. Three of them possessing the types: fire, water and grass. You will be accompanied by two friends that will embark on a journey with you to fill the pokedex and collect all 8 badges, beat the elite four and become champion. They act more or less as helpers throughout your journey. I would like to note that there is much more personality in each character compared to older versions, which gives the story more of a taste. Now as you all know there is always an antagonist that is trying to go against the common good, and in this game it would be Team Plasma. I don't want to give too many details about this organization, as that will spoil too much, but I like how the game had them impact the storyline in an interesting way.

Another great addition to black and white is the replay value. Not only is there wi-fi to keep players occupied battling it out with others, but there are plenty more to discover after the main story is completed. All the other pokemon in the national pokedex are available for encounter after completing the game. A lot of people probably wished they were available from the get-go, but its good the game forces you to use the new pokemon first. The elite four also become stronger after you have beaten the game, so that you can always go back and have a challenge or get a good amount of exp.

The most distinct aspect of pokemon black and white at first glance is probably the graphics. Yes, the graphics in battle and the environment are greatly improved. Especially the 3rd city you enter. The buildings and the camera angle produce an amazing view of the area. The bridge that leads to this city is great looking too. The only objects that appear as sprites are the people, but all environmental things are 3D models. They did a great job on the improvement of the graphics. Everything looks really cool. For the sceptics this is obviously for the DS' standards.

If you do decide to buy this new version of pokemon, make sure to check out the differences in the versions, because not only are there pokemon differences, but there is also certain location differences. Depending on what sounds better for you, you should get that version. There are a bunch of black/white version comparisons on YouTube or Google. Just search it up.

  ",9,"""Pokémon Blanco"" para DS es sin duda un gran videojuego y probablemente el mejor que ha sacado la saga de Pokémon. Fue lanzado en 2011 y puedo decir que es un de los juegos de Nintendo al que más horas ""habré metido"" (unas 150 horas). No es para menos, porque aparte de contar con una historia interesante y divertida lineal a través de la ""Región de Teselia"" en la cual nuestro entrenador viajará a través de diferentes escenarios,  también puedes conocer ciudades y pueblos (especial atención a Ciudad Porcelana), explorar zonas ocultas (me encantó explorar la ruta en la cual hay un desierto y ruinas por descubrir) y enfrentarte ""como buen juego de Pokémon"" a combates a manos de otros entrenadores.
El objetivo es típico, derrotar en combate a los líderes de los ""gimnasios Pokémon"" distribuidos en diferentes ciudades y cada uno supondrá un reto. Al final, nuestro pequeño héroe se enfrentará a la liga Pokémon. Aún así, tiene una verdadera trama, la cuál es derrotar o frenar los planes del ""Equipo Plasma"" y a su líder, ""N"". Su objetivo es liberar todos los Pokémon de los entrenadores y así dominar el mundo. La historia también tiene toques enigmáticos, personajes sombríos (N principalmente) y escenarios bellos, además de poseer una gran variedad de Pokémon normales y legendarios.
Otro punto positivo es la banda sonora, sin duda la mejor que se ha incluido en un juego de Pokémon y una de las mejores que habré escuchado.
Sin duda es un gran juego. Repetitivo; desde un punto de vista sí, pero este se trata de un juego más complejo y elaborado de lo que parece en la carátula."

  ",9,"For a long time I took the opinion only the first (and maybe the second) generation is great. I saw some of the Pokemon of the 4th and 5th generation and tought to myself: ""what the hell went wrong with Pokemon?! These creatures look so ugly!"" Someday I gave this generation a chance with no high hopes; I'm so glad that i dit this. I got a fantastic game with a beautiful and interesting story from the beginning. (Maybe the best storyline in all pokemon-games) It also feels totally new with so many new Pokemon and a giant (but beautifully designed) map. Anyway i totally understand people when they say ""those Pokemon look so ugly!"" - they are kinda right... I still dont like the designs of the legendaries to this day. But after a few hours in-game you will learn to deal with them and kinda fell in love with some of them. So 9 out of 10 because the Pokemon-design is lacking a bit. Let me tell you, I was absolutely sceptical before playing this game. But I can highly recommend it if you are a Pokemon-lover like me."

  ",10,"Best generation of Pokemon without a doubt. Not only has the best story out of all the games but also it reached its top with pokemon sprites (that I prefer over 3D models). I feel like it is one of the most underrated Pokemon games, having one of the most distinctive and visible split opinions out of all the games. Some will say that the designs are awful and uncreative but in my opinion, these games contain some of the best Pokemon designs, being Chandelure, Victini, Volcarona, Bisharp, Reuniclus and so much more, ones of my favorites. Another counterargument I hear a lot is that it's just a gen 1 rip-off, but even though it is true for some cases, the possibility to experience a similar gameplay experience with a 151-Pokemon Pokedex with only new Pokemon it's worth it. Of course, there's a lot of crap, but what do you expect from them, the had to make 151 new Pokemon, 151! That's not even close to the number of Pokemon we are getting these days! My point is that they ran out of ideas, of course, but is it too difficult to appreciate the effort they put to create these games and some of the good designs? Is it too difficult? According to most people and the rating, apparently yes. I'm just leaving this around here, and if you found this and made it through this whole comment, congratulations! You're probably either entitled and disagreeing or you were searching for a comment like this and you're nodding with your head, which seems improbable, but who knows. Either way, I'm reposting this on Black Version too, hoping for a person with a similar opinion to find this.

Story is silly as hell, Ghetsis is dumb just revealing his ""master plan"" to everyone every time he appears, Team Plasma is just a bad filler full of stupid dialogues doing incoherent stuff all the way. It's just really DUMB and childish.

The game only tells you something interesting at the beginning and at the very end, because the rest is just the same dull characters repeating their favourites words to remember you what to do. Disgusting. The plot make no sense at all since the moment they say you are the chosen one because: yes.

And let's not forget the bad Pokédex type balance, the MOST linear region of them all, the ugly and Kanto inspired Pokémon designs you must use (thanks GF for improve designs in the new generations), the pretentious the plot is always trying hard to be, the region being bland and similar to Kanto, the short main game...

Pokémon White version casts you directly into a new world filled with philosophy, friendship and betrayal
The story is this game is truly great for Pokémon standards and is to this day, the least “safe” Pokemon has ever played it. And it payed off big time
Memorable characters are literally everywhere (shoutout my main boi Grimsley and the greatest Pokémon character of all time N)
The music in this game is truly next level, equal to the superb Ruby/Sapphire soundtrack in my books

The new Pokémon really aren’t bad, some are worse than others but this Generation overall made solid additions to the Pokédex

If you are looking for a traditional Pokémon adventure this one is probably not for you, but if you are willing to play Pokémon differently (don’t mash through the dialogue) then this game will definitely be for you"

  ",9,"Unafraid to break from the conventions of previous series traditions, Pokemon Black/White are some of the most ambitious entries in their franchise and they're all the better for it.

Graphically it builds upon the 2D characters/3D world style established by the 4th Generation of games and builds a vibrant new world unlike any prior region, featuring bustling city scapes and attractive outdoor environments which change dramatically with the shift of in-game seasons. Pokémon themselves have shifted from ststic 2D sprites to crisply animated sprites which portray a lot more character in even the simplest motions and make things feel much nore alive.

The soundtrack has a very unique flavour compared to prior games, experimenting with layered and adaptive musical tracks on the overworld while featuring a variety of interesting and different themes for actual battles. Mechanically, this is one of the smoothest games in the series, featuring many QoL improvements and improvements upon established systems. Rotation battles and Triple battles are an interesting gimmick and fun to experiment with, but ultimately fail to secure their place as a solid mechanic and be anything more than a gimmick.

The narrative of the game is perhaps one of the most interesting evolutions, going beyond the normally rather simple good vs bad plots of the prior games and featuring a more extensive and prevalent story wherein the villain's aims can be considered more morally righteous than the player themselves.

In terms of content, Black/White took the radical decision not to feature any of the Pokémon featured in past games until the post-game, leading the player to explore through a world that feels entirely new. While this might be divisive amongst some people, I feel it's entirely to the game's advantage and creates a brand new world that feels fresher than ever. Plus, thanks to the transfer service available within the game, those 'mons thst don't have a place in the world can be imported fron the prior games meaning none are left out.

On the topic of post-game, Black/White features a fantastic selection of content to enjoy after the completion of the main storyline, unlocking an entire extra half of the region filled with additional content to explore.

On the weaker side are the networking activities beyond the established and proven battle/trading systems - the Entralink is a half-hearted attempt at bringing players together in the one world that ultimately amounts to nothing more than some busy work with little to be gained from it and the Dream World isn little more than a gimmick to get some slightly unique Pokémon variants.

In summary, Pokémon Black/White are some of the most interesting entries in such a veteran franchise and will probably be remembered for decades to come as one of the highest points for the entire franchise."

Unova felt like a distant corner of the world, when i finally played it (still the japanese version, because i could not wait for the american release) it was like i moved to a foreign land, where nobody speak the same language as me, and nothing was like anything i ever experienced with Pokémon, but at the same time it felt the same.
BW was the absolutely high end for the franchise. An insane amount of content, Pokemon, and exploration in just one game. And in the top of all that, we finally got a decent plot, with a amazing ending. Nothing will ever beat this game, as it stands as the best and most innovative pokemon game ever."

  ",4,"Don't get me wrong, it was a good game, maybe a 4 is little note... But I expected so much from this game. Someone told me this was the BEST Pokémon game to date and I decided i had to played it... So i did it and... Well... It's FAR from the best. And i'm not talking about the ugly Pokémon designs or whatever...

People that love this game, always talk about an 'amazing' plot, but it's not. It's just another Pokémon game like the previous generations but now with a green hair male talking and bothering you so much through the adventure to repeat almost the same things he said to you before. And you don't care at all, because he's not your friend, he's just a stranger, why the hell is he talking to you so much?

The bad guy Ghetsis is... SO BAD. Maybe not the worst villain (Hello XY) but it's just a stupid that don't know how to hide a plan. He spends 90% of the game revealing you and the rest of the people that he's bad and wants to destroy the world. What the hell?

People tend to romanticize this plot with 'the ideals', 'not everything is Black and White'... And yeah the idea is good, but it just doesn't work. You can't sell 'not everything is black or white' and then create a villain that is purely black and without reasons to be. Ghetsis it's bad because yes, because he born that way.

N was a good innovation in 2011, he was the first character to take away some prominence from the player, and that's great. Because although he has boring and redundant speeches, he's charismatic and memorable. But let's be realistic, we are in 2019, 'Sword & Shield' is near and 'Sun & Moon' has a much more catchy and interesting story, with little plot twists, great treated relations and well developed characters. For me the best game to date is Sun & Moon, at least talking about the story, and we'll se what happens with SWSH.

But for me, this game is good, has some problems with flaws in the Pokédex, linear map and things like that, but has great music, interesting topics, a great champion, good postgame and well... It's a Pokémon, it's a good game. The thing is that it's NOT the best, and if you're looking for the best one. For me you better play 'Sun & Moon' (not the USUM version please).

Hope this don't offend anyone, is great if you loved this game!"

+ Its still the same Pokémon combat.
+ Bulbapedia documented this game this game better than all other games until X and Y came out.
+ The dual-screen cutscene was cool.

Things I didn't like:
- Pokémon games kept getting more complex while not making gameplay more fun than Gen 2 in my opinion.
- There was way more of this beauty contest, grooming, etc **** in your face.
- ENCOUNTERS EVERY 2 GOD DAMN STEPS.
- The story was ridiculous.
- The game felt slow.  I play Crystal on emulator with speedup, so it might be me, but progress just doesn't feel fast.  So even if I emulated it, it wouldn't be my choice based on progression.
- The dual-screen Cutscene. :P  It slowed the game down so it can be a plus and a neg.
- Double Battles.  Now they're not just with trainers, they're in the wild.
- No clear instructions post beating elite four for first time.
- One ROM still only gets you 1 save slot.  C'mon Nintendo.  Just c'mon.

Overall, I don't want to go back to the game.  I know the majority of people love what's been changing in Pokémon, but I think the game designers went wrong a few ways.  They tried to fix things that didn't need fixing.  And all the things they actually improved on were the things I didn't care about or didn't like.  The ROM I played it on doesn't need to burn or anything.  But the game shall go ignored by me if its lucky. =P  Score: 3/10

PS.  You know what would be cool?  A drive-thru combination PokéCenter and -Mart.  It would just take 1 pump of a defibrillator and you're back on your journey.  Might not make actual health sense, but it is an idea that I have for making healing less time consuming and the game more fun."

  ",2,"Pokemon reached its peak early on with Gen 2 (Gold/Silver), still considered the best generation of Pokemon. Gen 3 (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald) and Gen 4 (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum) simply couldn't live up to the legacy of Gen 2. But, at least with those games, you could tell that Game Freak tried, and they cared about the Pokemon franchise back then. Cue Gen 5, and you'd have a hard time believing they ever cared at all. First off, imagine everything you've come to know and love about Pokemon, gone flying out the window. The game does not have any of the older Pokemon at all until you beat the story, instead you have to put up with the lame new Pokemon for 90% of the game. This really ruins the experience because nobody wants to be stuck with a team consisting of all crappy useless Pokemon, save for maybe your Starter, who will be the only one who can do jack crap. This is also the most gimmicky generation yet, featuring hordes of new crap that I can't be pissed to remember what it was all called, and ends up forgetting to tend to the core gameplay itself, and speaking of which... the battle system is the least polished in the series yet. It's actually a step backwards from the previous generations. All these flaws, and more, make for what was the worst Pokemon game at is time. But if you thought this was bad, you'll **** yourself when you see Black 2/White 2, which manages to be even WORSE, and ultimately drove the Pokemon series into the ground, maybe for good. and as for X/Y, that one was average. The last good Pokemon game they made was HeartGold/SoulSilver, and even then it was probably because that one was a remake of Gold/Silver."

  ",9,"Story & Characters: 8/10
With the improved 3D effect Game Freak is able portray a much more cinematic story than was possible in past games. Unlike past games the villainous gang have an interesting goal other than to simply steal Pokémon out of greed.  Team Plasma believes they are good guys trying to protect Pokémon from the cruelty of human ownership. However it doesn’t make much sense why they themselves use Pokémon to accomplish this goal. Although this is an interesting twist on the signature Pokémon storyline it is never really developed into a meaningful conclusion.

Like the past few titles the player has more than one rival, a friend from your home town and an evil rival. Black and White takes this further, the player now has two friends who battle and assist the player throughout the game. These characters however are very dull when compared to Wally or Blue. The main villain and rival “N” however is a breath of air with a great back story and interesting dialogue.

Visuals & Sound: 10/10
Black and White looks radically different to past games in the series introducing 3D like effect perhaps leading up to a 3DS version. This graphical update is the biggest leap in the series since the move from GBC to GBA. These 3D effects push the DS hardware to its limits but makes environments look stunning. However due to the limitations of the DS Pokémon in battles look pixelated and sometimes ugly in battles. The game includes pre-rendered cut scenes at some points in the game which look great but they are rarely shown.

Like every new generation Black and White introduces over 100 new species of Pokémon. However very few of these Pokémon look very impresssive compared to older generations.  Although they do not look very appealing it seems to be the most varied generation to date and is not plagued with a particular type such as normal in Red and Blue or water in Ruby and Sapphire.

Throughout the series they have introduced intro animations were Pokémon move briefly when the battle begins only for it to be removed in the next game in the series but brought back later on. These animations return in Black & White and although they slow down battles considerably they are appreciated. Due to the longer animations during battles, random encounters are much more frustrating taking several seconds before you can flee.

Gameplay: 10/10
Black & White keeps to the signature Pokémon formula.  Although it doesn’t bring anything revolutionary to the series it is the most refined and structured Pokémon game yet. These refinements include Pokémon Centres and Poke Marts being combined into a single building and unlimited TM uses. Other than these refinements Black & White adds some slight adjustments to keep the gameplay fresh, it introduces both triple battles and rotating battles. Rotating battles contain 3 Pokémon per side which are switch into a one v one battle each getting a single move before switching, meaning players have to anticipate future switches.

Unfortunately takes you by the hand throughout the campaign introducing you to locations even after you have your first badge. I understand they have this in the game but this shouldn’t go one beyond the first 30 minutes or should at least have some way to skip it. Black & White seems to be the easiest game yet in the series due to less emphasis on team type balancing and a lack of enemy powerhouses (Milktank in Gold and Silver). Continuing with the day and night feature introduced in Generation 2 Black & White introduces seasons alter both the appearance of the environment and the types of Pokémon you can catch.

Multiplayer & Extras: 9/10
Like the past few entries Black & White have a huge emphasis on player interaction. Early on in the game you are given a C-Gear which allows them to trade and battle with other players. Using friend codes you are able to interact with friends either wirelessly or online. However you are able to trade and battle with random players around the world online making it much more convenient to catch em all. The C-Gear also includes a past by feature which allows the player to exchange information with other players when in range.

Enjoyment: 9/10
Although Black & White is nothing game changing it an excellent entry into the series continuing to capture the magic that was introduced in Red & Blue. Besides being Pokémon games, Black & White are excellent turn based RPGs with a huge amount of content making them an excellent purchase for any RPG fan."

It's separated from the other games by forcing you to play with only the newest Pokemon.  That and the quicker pacing and smart structure, especially with how experience points work prevents you from being too strong and too weak.  It's probably also one of the more challenging experiences that I've had with Pokemon in awhile.

I also appreciate how the gym leaders appear outside the gym, really giving them personality and influence behind their title.

The same mechanics are utilized, and little to nothing new is brought to the table. Attempting to attract attention of leading the edge in modernization, by adding over a 150 new species to the Pokémon roster, it fails by doing little more than this. Triple battles and rotation battles, while a nice addition, are barely featured  and almost a backdoor surprise feature that you don't unearth unless you go looking for them. The Unova region is heavily grotesque in that it fails in its forced marriage of nature and urbanization. Within 30 seconds you are able to travel from a forest, to a bridge, to a metropolis, to a desert. The inspiration of New York City bares little resemblance outside of the trivial **** and harbors in Castelia City. Perhaps the only redeeming and general progression in the Pokémon series is the beautifully crafted soundtrack. However, outside of this there is little if anything new to the series."

Generation IV disappointed me greatly with an absurd over-the-top mess of a story and I was afraid the games were heading in the wrong direction.

However, generation V changed all of this, instantly becoming my favorite.

I can't quite put into words how much I enjoy Pokémon Black&White, so I'll just say this: I've played Pokémon ever since generation I, being a kid back then. And yet despite the huge nostalgia boost the first generation has, gen V easily wins in my ranking.

Personally I recommend White version, as it has, in my opinion, more interesting version-exclusive Pokémon and locations."

  ",9,"Pokemon White, along with black adds a lot of awesome features to the Pokemon franchise, along with even more new pokemon.

I find this game amazing as every other Pokemon game.
But even though it is a must buy, it somehow removes a lot of simple commands with the menus from HeartGold, along with the way you can interact with the touch screen to manage items and menus quicker.

It might sound like a minor thing, but along with the fights having a kind of slow startup, the game many times feels like it lacks the pace HeartGold seemed to have. Because Pokemon is after all an RPG with fun grinding, exploring, item collecting etc. and when you are doing a quest, errand or one of many day-time events, scrolling between menus, choosing ""fly"" back and forth changing the menu back to the bike, etc. becomes way more tedious than it should be.

Its still an amazing game with all its new features, but it feels like it lack a little bit of magic from previous entries.

9 out of 10, and that comes from someone whos a HUGE fan of the franchise."

  ",5,"I'm going to come off as a ""Gen-Oner"" because what I'm going to say is going to sound like me just hating on the new and appreciating the old. that said, Generation 5 Pokemon, to me, lost a lot of small things that made the series great and left me with a less than fun experience. Pokemon White is the first Pokemon game where I stopped playing partway through and haven't picked it up since then. There are plenty of reasons why and because this is a review, I guess I'll just lay them out here.
First, the franchise no longer has any teeth to it. The once terrifying moment of having a poisoned Pokemon and nothing to heal them with has lost all tension because poison status no longer hurts outside of battle. And even if it did, it feels like there is a healer on every route. There's no threat or challenge to exploring the world, which is the main reason I want to explore. To find dangerous situations and create tension by getting lost or cornered. And Pokemon has been a game franchise that, in my opinion, was all about exploration of big worlds. Generation IV (Diamond and Pearl) was perfect because the environments were bigger, had more variety, and were things you actually could get kind of lost in. Here, I never really felt like there was much variety and that I had my hand held the entire time I was going through it.
The story is also a load of piss on my bread. The idea that the bad guys are like Pokemon PETA is a fun concept that I wish had played out better (read spoilers to see how things actually turn out... and it is kind of dumb). PETA is a terrible organization and it would have been cool to see that shown here to some degree, but it was sort of a referential nod towards those maniacs and not really more than that. So, much like Magma, Aqua, Galactic, and the rest, Team Plasma fails to live up the reputation of Team Rocket which actually killed a Pokemon, cloned a legendary Pokemon that nearly killed everyone, and forcibly evolved a Magikarp into a more enraged Gyarados. It's like you aren't even trying with this GameFreak. Next thing you'll do is make a referential character to Michael Vick who isn't really anything like Michael Vick at all beyond a mere reference when you could do so much more with that too.
Gameplay wise, it's really more of the same. While that's normally not bad, here it seems old hat. It's a copy-paste of generation IV with a few new moves and triple battles (which I feel don't add to this game as much as I wish they did). I'm not asking for a major change in how things work, but more than a few tweaks should be done to justify the makings of a new generation. Because I hardly see any real changes here from the last one.
On top of that, the one thing I used to go to Pokemon for (exploration) was further knee-capped by the game constantly wanting to shove a big-ol story down my throat. I get that you guys want to give us more narrative and story to these games as a flimsy justification for their existence. But I always found it more fun when the story was minimalisitic and you just learned about the world through exploration (the Lab on Cinnabar Island being the BEST example of this). But when I enter a town, the last thing I want is to not play for ten minutes while characters I don't care about spend forever explaining the game's tediously pointless plot to me. I just want to hunt animals and fight them to be the best trainer in the world. I don't have time to fight some green-haired  and his stupid friends.
To me, Generation V is a huge let down. I see lots of good ideas, especially with the Pokemon Dream World online situation they have going on. But the core game itself doesn't feel like the Pokemon I've loved for the past four generations. It has bits and pieces that seem familiar, but it has so much extra fluff and flab that the game I love is only a small fraction of what remains. So unless Generation VI can somehow reinvigorate the same level of excitement Generation IV did, then I'll just say this is where my Pokemon following ends... until Nintendo grows the balls to finally make a Pokemon MMO that we all want."

Cities have been designed well with brand new camera angles and there is plenty to keep you going after you beat the Pokemon League.

But I really, really can't help but hear the screams of ""INNOVATION"" that come from the business meetings of whoever's in charge of making these games. It's not a problem becuase ""changes ****"", and not even ""THESE changes ****"". It's just that they are all so unnecessary. Pokémon is already very, very commercial, and already has this terrible tendency to make a very good feature and then remove it in the next installment (which I guess is a good excuse to go and replay the older titles), and along with that with each generation the Pokémon designs get worse and worse to the point that the fan-made ones are starting to look like popsicles in a desert to me, while the official one start to look... like popsicles. Literally. Before you rant about this last complaint, let me get this straight: Pokémon has always had at least some bad designs, since Generation I, all I mean is that the percentage of badly thought Pokémon in each new generation is CONSTANTLY INCREASING. So with all these ""periodic flaws"", I feel like this title is not only natural culmination of those, but deals the final blow with unimpressive changes. The graphics are better and without having switched to some 3D gimmick, however, and I'd also like to stress that with this new wave of Pokémon the metagame is refreshed, and that's never a bad thing. Changing the mechanics of sleep was an interesting choice, for instance."

Audinos and Lucky Egg making the game lose ANY traces of challenge it ever had? And that's only scratching the top of a mountain of problems this game has. Truth to be told, the game has some improvements. Mostly minor, and/or completely irrelevant to the franchise as a whole (like a plot) but there are still there.

  ",9,"Going into Pokemon White after not having played a Pokemon game since Ruby, part of me felt skeptical that this was going to be a complete copy and paste of Diamond/Pearl, with better graphics and new Pokemon. However, it is much more than that.
First of all, the story has been given A LOT of care this time round, and it shows. This time, it's Team Plasma that you have to stop, this time being a Pokemon version of PETA, wanting to let all Pokemon be free and away from humans. The story isn't what you'd call 'award-winning', but it did keep me going all the way to the end.
They did also improve the graphics and add new Pokemon, as well. The graphics don't look that much different to the fourth generation, but have been made more 3D with different camera angles and makes the Unova region feel more alive than any other region in the series. The new Pokemon, however, are kind of a mixed bag. There are certainly good ones, such as the three starters and their evolutions, Zekrom and Reshiram shown on the front covers as well as Zoura and Zoroark. However, ones such as Klink and Vanillish seem like Game Freak are reaching the end of the barrel. The gameplay has been slightly changed too. The combat feels a bit faster and the animations look pretty great, even if the Pokemon graphics look a bit pixelated. There are even small details, such as a shiny Pokemon glistening and a sleeping Pokemon closing their eyes. There has also been some music changes, such as a small remix of the original beeping sound whenever your current Pokemon's health gets into the red. But the satisfying crunch of a super effective hit and the disappointing bump of a non-effective hit are still there. Oh, and Team Plasma's theme? Awesome. That's all I can say.

Overall, if you're a fan of Pokemon, you probably have this game by now, and if you don't, you really should.
If you're someone that complains about Pokemon 'not being the same' or 'having too many Pokemon', then try it out. From start to end of the story, it's JUST the new Pokemon. Some may not like that at first, but you'll probably get used to it at the end.
I wouldn't recommend this to critics of Pokemon in terms of the gameplay, because it's only a slight change since Diamond/Pearl. In my opinion, though, this is the best Pokemon game since the first generation. And that should mean a lot."

It often draws me back in to finding pokemon that I haven't captured yet, and the story is interesting enough to where I've wanted to complete it to see how things come together. The problem is I've reached an area about halfway through after obtaining 4 badges and dozens of pokemon where the general combat and exploration is getting pretty monotonous.

(Except for Trubbish, there's no saving him) the gameplay is Pokemon, that hasn't changed. There are now two rivals, so one you will have an advantage over, while the other still has the advantage over you. It is a nice touch to have the rivals as the characters friends, building upon that found in Ruby/Saphire/Emerald. there are a few new moves that you'll have to familiarize yourself with, as well as some new type combinations. The new pokemon are cool, and even the hideous ones are okay after a while. The new region is fun to explore, and the story is the best of the series.

  ",10,"I love this game, Pokemon has always been my favorite video game franchise, and White was the first game I ever preordered and rushed to the store on launch day for, and I am not at all disapointed with the final product. The graphics are similar to previous DS installments, but are given new life with cool camera angles and full animations for every single Pokemon, whitch made all 156 new ones look great and gives the previous 493 a new life. Gameplay is the same, but there was never anything wrong with it in the first place. To sum it up, if you own a DS, or even just bought a new 3DS, this is the game to get."

  ",9,"Pokemon Black and White is the most original and refreshing entry in the series since Pokemon's first inception. Over ten years have passed since I was first exposed to my Blue version, and the series is still going strong. Game Freak is a truly amazing developer, with their uncanny ability to rejuvenate what is essentially a bunch of rock-paper-scissors battle. Pokemon is still one of the most enriching and addicting RPGs out there."

  ",9,"I've had more fun and enjoyment with this game than Dragon Age II for the PC.  My introductory to Pokemon was Blue for the Game Boy when I was a kid.  As an adult now, I tried White and it made me reminiscent the fond memories and good times of Blue.  As one reviewer has truthfully stated, this game does have the reply value and you'd instantaneously be addicted easily.  Nothing really more needs to be said as the three reviewers below my review have said it nicely and an accurate spot on.  I'm a gamer who feels Pokemon exceeds to all ages and not kids, This is a solid rpg with strategy elements on the handheld.  White and Black are definitely a DS title to pick up and you'd get your money's worth.  Recommended to everyone."

  ",9,"I have played Pokemon for a very long time. I told myself that this game would be no different to the ones that came before it. I can't believe I ever thought that. This game is new and fun and full of surprises! I can't wait to get my 3DS in the mail and pop this into it, that will be the first thing I do. This game has replay value out the back and I can't wait to buy my second copy. Well done Nintendo."

  ",9,"So close to perfect. The gameplay mechanics have been tweaked beautifully and the world to explore is vast and fresh, triple battles add a whole lot more strategy to the game and the graphics are gorgeously simplistic (nice to see the return of pixelated close-up sprites, blast from the past from Pokemon Yellow right there). It's just a shame that a few of the new pokemon feel rushed and weak."

  ",9,I posted a review of Black and so I thought I would post a similar one for White since I have both but instead of copying my other one I am going to cover some of the features on this one I did not on my review of Black.. I really liked how they added triple battles and rotation battles but tri type pokemon would have been nice. Another thing that would have been nice is a dragon Evveeloution but it is forgivable. The camera has some cool angles but it is a little overhyped. Zekrom and Reshiram are cool but the elemental legendaries which have those weird names one is which is a fire tpye is pretty weird. As for graphics they were improved but not earth ****. Full 3d like in Battle Revolution would be nice. As well as Pokemon appearing in the over world with no need to walk through grass but you cannot have it all. The sound is good but not as classic or as awesome as HG/SS but it is still a worthy effort and a great rethinking of the series that comes a little short of perfection. I give both versions a 9/10
