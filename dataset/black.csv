  ",9,"These game often has mixed opinions and I can see why, but I'm on the positive side. One of the biggest complaints is the new Pokemon. There is a fair majority of stinkers, but that is to be expected, especially when the game adds the most amount of new Pokemon in series history. It switches things up by making these new creatures the only ones obtainable, but it does provide a different feel from old games. The game further changes things by showing that Game Freak can, and sometimes want, to give a story to their games. The writing and characters are stellar. The villain is intimidating, and the ending is a memorable one. As with most Pokemon games is the amazing music, as there are a lot of killer songs. The game also looks pretty good for the hardware it's on. Overall, this game does a lot of things right. It has a pretty good selection of Pokemon, with some being among the best in the series. It tells a unique story that works really well with the music, characters, and atmosphere. The game, even outside of Pokemon standards in truly an ""N""credible game."

However: I must warn you to definitively get White version if you have no other available Pokemon games. It has 100 extra version exclusives not in Black because of a postgame area called White Forest (Black version has Black City instead)."

I've played it on physical console and I've had lots of fun. I've tried it previously on emulators but such approach doesn't ignite a spark of joy.
In terms of story-telling, lore and world-building this game should get straight 10 - but after reaching some point of the game near the end the grind becomes unbearably dull and legend hunting isn't as good as in previous (and later) installments in series.
Even though I've spent about 150h on this game it doesn't have factor that would make me repeat whole adventure any time in the future."

They did an excellent job with the new pokemon- you’d always find a few new things in every route, making you feel like there’s always more to discover, and the pokemon themselves are some of the most well-designed in the series, even if some of them don’t evolve until very late. The story is excellent (a first for the series), and as formulaic as it may be, I believe these games truly mastered the formula."

I'm just gonna leave it at this. tl;dr - Pokemon Black and White, as GAMES, are kinda mid. the climax was epic. the story was flawed and really boring much of the way through. the gameplay is super dull and barren for a pokemon game, almost as much so as the gen 1 games. this was disappointing for a game 5 generations in. Even games like XY people find are barebones have so much more to them in the gameplay aspect than Black and White. BW added detrimental features like the critical health theme, holding hostage the quality of each fight, the postgame was overrated, as it was simply 3 cities you explored with little incentive and not much reward. The Battle Subway is heavily lackluster in comparison to gens 3-4 battle facilities and gens 6-7 battle facilities, despite being the only battle facility in this game."

With a brand-new cast of 156 Pokémon to catch, the largest amount introduced before or after, many people grew hostile to many of the monsters due to not being allowed to use any old favorites in the main story, which is a shame as Pokémon Black and White have the strongest story out of the entire series with the best engine to date both in and outside of battle. A region brimming with life and diversity of location and people alike, Pokémon Black and White are fantastic games that are deserving of being the series' penultimate sendoff for the Nintendo DS."

  ",5,"UPDATE
Pokémon Black introduces us to the Unova region, a bustling melting pot of diverse cities, settlements, folklore and ideas. That is the stage of the player's adventure as playfully vibrant, resounding musical pieces accentuate the lively nature of the region and permeate the journey with an endearingly exuberant feel. A journey characterized by a surprising amount of interesting character arcs, in a much more story-driven experience tackling unusually mature topics for the series like one's purpose in life, the clash of different ideologies, abuse and propaganda. Regrettably, all of this is done in a pretty simplistic way to avoid straying too far from the intended target audience, but it's nonetheless the most engaging plot and cast of characters in the series yet. Gameplay on the other hand doesn't do much to innovate the series' core formula, which can often be quite monotonous and repetitive especially by today's standards, but at least a pleasant level of challenge keeps the player on edge against the strongest adversaries, and the layered level design provides some rich, engaging exploration. Pokémon Contests do not make a return to leave room for Musicals, which are a dramatically worse side-activity with less depth, content and player agency."

  ",10,"Pokemon Black is peak Pokemon. Something I never expected a Pokemon game to accomplish (especially by modern standards) is tell a compelling, deep and lovely story from start to finish. Characters such as Cheren, and Bianca are great rivals throughout the adventure, going on self actualizing arcs of their own to figure out what they want to be in this world. The show stealer in characters, however, has to be N. A trainer without a heart fostered by Ghetsis, who admittedly I was a little disappointed by his overall goal not to separate people from Pokemon, a motive that a lot of people can easily get behind, but was instead to take over Unova. Unova itself is a great take on the ‘UNited states OV America’ taking you on very different biomes, Castelia City being the obvious stand out, not to mention it’s soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole is outstanding, my favorite theme being the amazing ending, with the bittersweet ‘farewell.’ Another particular stand out is the low-health theme, whenever your pokemon are on low health. Be prepared to listen to it a lot during the Elite 4. My favorite part about the game was probably the Elite 4, in how clawing your way through them you face Team Plasma’s hostile takeover of the Pokemon League and have to face the culminating battle of N, and then finally Ghetsis as your final challenge. Difficulty in this game rocked me, I blacked out multiple times, especially on the Elite 4 and champion. Unova’s selection of Pokemon is staggering compared to other titles, this being because you can only catch new Pokemon until the post game. Personally, I like the roster introduced in Gen 5 so I was very happy with my team that I took to the end. Zebstrika you were the GOAT. It’s hard to give this game anything but a 10, Pokemon in itself is so charming, especially during this era, and Black is undoubtedly the peak of the series. (yes there is a little bit of nostalgia talking)"

A far more responsive battle speed (my god, the Generation 4 battle pace were horrible), probably some of the best graphic style for DS and sprite work bar a few give so much life to the creatures and the environment. The new Pokemon roster is also quite diverse enough to not make different playthrough monotonous. Story is a bit more thought provoking and better than previous iterations. The map progression leads it to being a linear game, but due to various features like Dream World, Entralink and others (Musicals, they aren't that much liked or used by people), it feels decent enough room to explore. The main story beat ends in a bang. Post-game areas (Black City and White Forest) and the Looker quest were nice but the main draw is Battle Subway. Fantastic facility. While it is a solid entry in the franchise, the extra facilities and features brought by its sequels (B2W2) makes for the best Unova adventure then these. I do recommend playing through BW once through the post-game since our progress can be synced for rewards on the sequels."

The story is perhaps one of the better ones, with a theme of 'questioning' and 'opposites', and it was a great take on something that wasn't really done before, and it was a game where you could actually understand where the villains were coming from with their ideals.

The characters are very memorable, the music is memorable, and of course, the game mechanics - Triple, Rotation battles - is memorable, and sometimes dearly loved within the Pokemon community.

In 2022, the time of this review, this game is still highly in the recommended list for 'Best Pokemon Experience'"

  ",9,"Pokémon Negro y Blanco me parecen de los juegos más arriesgados de la saga, al quitar en un principio los pokémon de otras regiones y contarnos una historia más atrevida. La banda sonora es espectacular y las rutas son fantasticas, dando diferentes caminos y siendo generalmente más largas y por ende más retadoras, la dificultad está a un buen nivel y los personajes son de sobre saliente, muy diferente a lo que la saga nos tenía acostumbrados. El único fallo que le pondría es el diseño de algúnos pokémon, es de esperar que no todos gusten, ya que entre 156 nuevos pokémon (Un numero a destacar) algunos serán y otros no de tu agrado, aunque algúnos se sienten que están fuertemente inspirados en los que se nos presentaron en la primera generación."

  ",10,"Best generation of Pokemon without a doubt. Not only has the best story out of all the games but also it reached its top with pokemon sprites (that I prefer over 3D models). I feel like it is one of the most underrated Pokemon games, having one of the most distinctive and visible split opinions out of all the games. Some will say that the designs are awful and uncreative but in my opinion, these games contain some of the best Pokemon designs, being Chandelure, Victini, Volcarona, Bisharp, Reuniclus and so much more, ones of my favorites. Another counterargument I hear a lot is that it's just a gen 1 rip-off, but even though it is true for some cases, the possibility to experience a similar gameplay experience with a 151-Pokemon Pokedex with only new Pokemon it's worth it. Of course, there's a lot of crap, but what do you expect from them, the had to make 151 new Pokemon, 151! That's not even close to the number of Pokemon we are getting these days! My point is that they ran out of ideas, of course, but is it too difficult to appreciate the effort they put to create these games and some of the good designs? Is it too difficult? According to most people and the rating, apparently yes. I'm just leaving this around here, and if you found this and made it through this whole comment, congratulations! You're probably either entitled and disagreeing or you were searching for a comment like this and you're nodding with your head, which seems improbable, but who knows. Either way, I'm reposting this on White Version too, hoping for a person with a similar opinion to find this.

Story is silly as hell, Ghetsis is dumb just revealing his ""master plan"" to everyone every time he appears, Team Plasma is just a bad filler full of stupid dialogues doing incoherent stuff all the way. It's just really DUMB and childish.

The game only tells you something interesting at the beginning and at the very end, because the rest is just the same dull characters repeating their favourites words to remember you what to do. Disgusting. The plot make no sense at all since the moment they say you are the chosen one because: yes.

And let's not forget the bad Pokédex type balance, the MOST linear region of them all, the ugly and Kanto inspired Pokémon designs you must use (thanks GF for improve designs in the new generations), the pretentious the plot is always trying hard to be, the region being bland and similar to Kanto, the short main game...

Some may see that as a downside but I like to see what's new when it comes to Pokemon games. The story is probably the best in the series to date, and it all comes to a head when you reach the Pokemon League. I'd rather not spoil it for those who somehow haven't played it by now, but the climax is amazing. There's quite a few interesting dungeons and secrets scattered about the region, even places you might initially miss on your first playthrough. There's a lot to explore here, and I love it. The post-game is basically just checking out a previously unavailable portion of the region. The sprite work is phenomenal, and really helps the Pokemon feel alive.
Overall, this is one of the best in the series."

Don't get me wrong, it was a good game, maybe a 4 is little note... But I expected so much from this game. Someone told me this was the BEST Pokémon game to date and I decided i had to played it... So i did it and... Well... It's FAR from the best. And i'm not talking about the ugly Pokémon designs or whatever...

People that love this game, always talk about an 'amazing' plot, but it's not. It's just another Pokémon game like the previous generations but now with a green hair male talking and bothering you so much through the adventure to repeat almost the same things he said to you before. And you don't care at all, because he's not your friend, he's just a stranger, why the hell is he talking to you so much?

The bad guy Ghetsis is... SO BAD. Maybe not the worst villain (Hello XY) but it's just a stupid that don't know how to hide a plan. He spends 90% of the game revealing you and the rest of the people that he's bad and wants to destroy the world. What the hell?

People tend to romanticize this plot with 'the ideals', 'not everything is Black and White'... And yeah the idea is good, but it just doesn't work. You can't sell 'not everything is black or white' and then create a villain that is purely black and without reasons to be. Ghetsis it's bad because yes, because he born that way.

N was a good innovation in 2011, he was the first character to take away some prominence from the player, and that's great. Because although he has boring and redundant speeches, he's charismatic and memorable. But let's be realistic, we are in 2019, 'Sword & Shield' is near and 'Sun & Moon' has a much more catchy and interesting story, with little plot twists, great treated relations and well developed characters. For me the best game to date is Sun & Moon, at least talking about the story, and we'll se what happens with SWSH.

But for me, this game is good, has some problems with flaws in the Pokédex, linear map and things like that, but has great music, interesting topics, a great champion, good postgame and well... It's a Pokémon, it's a good game. The thing is that it's NOT the best, and if you're looking for the best one. For me you better play 'Sun & Moon' (not the USUM version please).

  ",7,"Story is a main focus for this game. Pokemon had been adding more and more story to their games up to the release of Pokemon Black Version and this game delivered one of the best stories yet.  It challenges many things that you think about the Pokemon world and treats you more like a true hero than a kid playing a video game. Almost all of the new content to this game is memorable and fantastic, especially the season changing feature, where the seasons in game will change every few weeks. Pokemon Black Version also had the cleanest graphics and art out of all of the 2D Pokemon games to compliment its variety of music, moods, and events.

The reason this game falls a bit short is mostly its ambitiousness not quite paying off. The quick connection feature is something you rarely use, that Game Freak seems to have put a lot of time into. It seems like they wanted to expand into an online oriented game before moving the series to 3DS, when they should have waited for their next main series game instead. The ""triple battles"" was something I was so excited for when the game first came out, but I'm not sure I ever even used it.

Most of what Game Freak did for this game, was a massive leap for the series, but they tried to do too much, too fast. The game is definitely an exciting and engaging one, but too many features were a let down."

Creo que ""Blanco y Negro"" necesitan un buen remake que dé vida a posiblemente la región más sosa de la saga junto a Kanto.

No fue un mal juego, pero fue más de lo mismo. Poca innovación, poco arriesgar, poco más que la primera historia memorable de la franquicia.

Los diseños la transforman en la generación que más añadió, pero que menos funciona. Los Pokémon iniciales son seguramente los menos ""bonitos"" de la saga.  Aún así, creo que ciertos Pokémon cuentan con un diseño arriesgado pero acertado, el problema principal de los diseños es que el 80% intentan copiar los diseños de la primera generación.

De hecho, estos son los juegos que más se basan sin duda en ""Rojo y Azul"" fue un intento fallido de ""Reboot"" para la saga.

La dificultad es nula, sin llegar al extremo de facilidad que tocaron ""X e Y"", pero convirtiéndose en uno de los juegos más fáciles de toda la saga.

  ",10,"This game is truly masterful and breathes new life into the pokemon series, in more ways than one. Game Freak took a big chance in removing all the pokemon from the previous games, however I think this give the player a chance to experience something great. You are now put into a situation where you cannot rely on using the same pokemon you have been using years before. You must dig down back into the roots of pokemon, when you first started playing. That experience of seeing a new pokemon, that feeling of trying to come up with a team of pokemon you have never used before. It's a truly nostalgic experience. Looking at some of the designs of the pokemon of this game you'll see that many are similar to the original 151. This allows the players to have an idea of how the new pokemon will play, while still changing the pokemon around enough to make them unique from the originals. The designs are incredibly fresh as well, with nothing overly complicated (except for a handful of very specific ones), but nothing boringly simple. There are some REALLY amazing designs in this game, some of which are a little darker than others if you dig deep into their lore, giving the game a bit of a more adult feel. In addition, the plot to this game is magnificent (by pokemon standards). It asks the player challenging, adult questions at times, and some players are left to ponder their childhood games. There's actually quite some bit of character development in the games rivals and main antagonist. In addition, there's a bunch of great surprises that will keep this game outstandingly fresh, especially towards the end.

In conclusion, this game was made for the fans. Game Freak knew the players of the original games where getting more mature and many wanted a little more significant pokemon game. So, Game Freak decided to make a game for them. It is a game that appeals to the new players in that there are crisp and cool new pokemon designs, and keeps the basic elements of the games beforehand. It appeals to older pokemon players in that they can get a fresh breath of air, while still being able to go on an adventure similar to their first encounter with the game. It fixes some minor issues, challenges older players, and holds what is probably some of the best pokemon Game Freak have to offer. Over all, it is (in my humble opinion), the best pokemon game to date.

Team Plasma is the most interesting villian team in the whole franchise, moving from stupid or clichéd goals like ""let's steal every pokemon"" or ""let's expand the sea"" to much deeper questions with no definite answer like ""why should pokemons work for us?"", that makes for a superb story. The game's progression is much more defined by the actions of this organization, as opposed to just getting all the badges. Most Gym Leaders have actual personalities and roles in the story too, and I don't want to spoil it, but the ending of the game is one of the best i've seen in a pokemon game (after GS). It's a shame Nintendo is moving away from this game's features, as they triggered a very nostalgic part in people who played the first games and where more challenging (I don't think I've ever spent that much time trying to beat the pokemon league).

  ",9,"Story & Characters: 8/10
With the improved 3D effect Game Freak is able portray a much more cinematic story than was possible in past games. Unlike past games the villainous gang have an interesting goal other than to simply steal Pokémon out of greed.  Team Plasma believes they are good guys trying to protect Pokémon from the cruelty of human ownership. However it doesn’t make much sense why they themselves use Pokémon to accomplish this goal. Although this is an interesting twist on the signature Pokémon storyline it is never really developed into a meaningful conclusion.

Like the past few titles the player has more than one rival, a friend from your home town and an evil rival. Black and White takes this further, the player now has two friends who battle and assist the player throughout the game. These characters however are very dull when compared to Wally or Blue. The main villain and rival “N” however is a breath of air with a great back story and interesting dialogue.

Visuals & Sound: 10/10
Black and White looks radically different to past games in the series introducing 3D like effect perhaps leading up to a 3DS version. This graphical update is the biggest leap in the series since the move from GBC to GBA. These 3D effects push the DS hardware to its limits but makes environments look stunning. However due to the limitations of the DS Pokémon in battles look pixelated and sometimes ugly in battles. The game includes pre-rendered cut scenes at some points in the game which look great but they are rarely shown.

Like every new generation Black and White introduces over 100 new species of Pokémon. However very few of these Pokémon look very impresssive compared to older generations.  Although they do not look very appealing it seems to be the most varied generation to date and is not plagued with a particular type such as normal in Red and Blue or water in Ruby and Sapphire.

Throughout the series they have introduced intro animations were Pokémon move briefly when the battle begins only for it to be removed in the next game in the series but brought back later on. These animations return in Black & White and although they slow down battles considerably they are appreciated. Due to the longer animations during battles, random encounters are much more frustrating taking several seconds before you can flee.

Gameplay: 10/10
Black & White keeps to the signature Pokémon formula.  Although it doesn’t bring anything revolutionary to the series it is the most refined and structured Pokémon game yet. These refinements include Pokémon Centres and Poke Marts being combined into a single building and unlimited TM uses. Other than these refinements Black & White adds some slight adjustments to keep the gameplay fresh, it introduces both triple battles and rotating battles. Rotating battles contain 3 Pokémon per side which are switch into a one v one battle each getting a single move before switching, meaning players have to anticipate future switches.

Unfortunately takes you by the hand throughout the campaign introducing you to locations even after you have your first badge. I understand they have this in the game but this shouldn’t go one beyond the first 30 minutes or should at least have some way to skip it. Black & White seems to be the easiest game yet in the series due to less emphasis on team type balancing and a lack of enemy powerhouses (Milktank in Gold and Silver). Continuing with the day and night feature introduced in Generation 2 Black & White introduces seasons alter both the appearance of the environment and the types of Pokémon you can catch.

Multiplayer & Extras: 9/10
Like the past few entries Black & White have a huge emphasis on player interaction. Early on in the game you are given a C-Gear which allows them to trade and battle with other players. Using friend codes you are able to interact with friends either wirelessly or online. However you are able to trade and battle with random players around the world online making it much more convenient to catch em all. The C-Gear also includes a past by feature which allows the player to exchange information with other players when in range.

Enjoyment: 9/10
Although Black & White is nothing game changing it an excellent entry into the series continuing to capture the magic that was introduced in Red & Blue. Besides being Pokémon games, Black & White are excellent turn based RPGs with a huge amount of content making them an excellent purchase for any RPG fan."

While the gameplay is incredibly familiar and addicting and it has great visuals for the DS, the story itself is meh, especially towards the ending. The music, while good, is pretty forgettable and for a Pokemon game, that's a negative. However, the game itself is very fun and addicting especially with friends, but it is not the best Pokemon installment."

  ",7,"An essential reboot of the Pokémon handheld titles, Pokémon Black and Pokémon White are not so innovative as they might aspire to be. The same mechanics are utilized, and little to nothing new is brought to the table. Attempting to attract attention of leading the edge in modernization, by adding over a 150 new species to the Pokémon roster, it fails by doing little more than this. Triple battles and rotation battles, while a nice addition, are barely featured  and almost a backdoor surprise feature that you don't unearth unless you go looking for them. The Unova region is heavily grotesque in that it fails in its forced marriage of nature and urbanization. Within 30 seconds you are able to travel from a forest, to a bridge, to a metropolis, to a desert. The inspiration of New York City bares little resemblance outside of the trivial **** and harbors in Castelia City. Perhaps the only redeeming and general progression in the Pokémon series is the beautifully crafted soundtrack. However, outside of this there is little if anything new to the series."

  ",8,"Largely due to the fact that it was pretty much perfect in the first place the Pokemon series has changed very little in the last fifteen years. Despite this the developers have listened to some of the criticisms leveled at the games and included a number of the improvements fans have long been asking for.

The game of course still sees the player taking on the role of a child travelling from town to town collecting Pokemon and using them to battle all manner of opponents. Despite the familiar concept Pokemon Black is a more streamlined experience. Little things like combining the Pokemon Centre and Poke Mart into one building for example cuts down on pointless travelling whilst battles also run at a slightly quicker pace.

Two new types of battle are also included. Triple battles obviously allow for three Pokemon to fight at once whilst rotation battles allow the player to switch out Pokemon before each attack adding a new level of strategy to the game. Some Pokemon can now also combine moves to create more powerful attacks making the selection of a balanced team even more essential.

For the first time since the Game Boy original this version features a completely new set of Pokemon. Many of these are not as well designed as the original group but it does make exploration more interesting. No longer will you enter a cave to be greeted by yet another Zubat or Geodude. It is possible to get some of the older Pokemon once you complete the game or by using some of the bonus features but as per usual most have to be transferred from your save games on previous iterations.

Wrongly looked upon as 'a game for kids' Pokemon remains once the most in depth and strategic RPGs available on any console and with its more streamlined approach the Black or White game are as good a place to start as any."

When someone brings up the Generation 5 Pokemon, immediately people will bring up the ""ice cream Pokemon."" Yes, there is an ice cream Pokemon. It was a generic design and a bad idea. That is no excuse to rate this game low. If Magneton were to come out in generation 5, everyone would be like ""really? an magnet Pokemon? How lame!"" but because of it's release date, it is embraced as an original Pokemon and given much praise and love. Magneton the magnet Pokemon is just as generic as Vanilluxe the vanilla ice cream Pokemon.

The storyline in the Pokemon games has always been predictable yet satisfying. This installment breaks the chain. The story was not as predictable and had odd twists in it every now and again.

I was definitely wrong. The starters are awesome. Although the start of the game is a little slow, it gets much better when you meet team Plasma, and begin to expand your team with new exciting and beautifully crafted Pokémon. There are a few minor things which could be improved. I think the battles go to slowly. If there was an option that could speed up the animations a bit, it would have saved me a lot of time. Another thing I'd like to mention is that there are far too many Normal and Flying type Pokemon. Some of them are cool like the ancient Pokémon Archeops (Flying type) or the cute dog Pokémon Lillipup (Normal), which eventually evolves into a huge dog, which is the first dog Pokémon I have ever used on my team. Old fans of the game might miss the classic first gen Pokémon, but if you just enjoy the game until after you beat the Pokémon League you will be able to find Pokémon from earlier generations. This, in addition to the already great variation of Pokémon in the game, and a huge potential for replayability adds up to create a game in which I have been completely lost in for several days already. This is a must for every DS owner."

For pros:156 new pokemon,better game-play mechanics,decent enough story,and a large world.

For cons:About 70% of these pokemon look too bulky and unnatural to be considered 'pokemon',the game-play mechanics improved in the multi-player section and dreamworld,but other then that,its still just the same old pokemon formula,the story was good but previous games have had better,the large world is pretty linear to the plot,so you'll be walking in a strait line to the elite four.

Bottom line,if you are a new pokemon fan,Have younger siblings that want to try pokemon for the first time,or just a more die-hard fan then this one is for **** if your anything but the above,then I recommend the games:Pokemon Heart Gold and Sould Silver."

On a positive note the graphic improvements are  breath of fresh air. The characters although ugly, are at least clear, and the background scenery is nice.

Here's my thing with Pokemon: I like the play style every time. They take the same ol classic Pokemon gameplay and update it with some good changes to make it feel new. I think this time they might have gone a bit overboard, though. It doesn't play like the Pokemon we know and love. Now the number one most important thing to me with Pokemon games: the post-game. I really liked the second and fourth gens (and Emerald in the third gen) because there was so much to do after you beat the Elite Four, and I never actually found myself deleting my save. In Black and White... there's almost nothing. You can go catch a few legendaries. That's it. There's no captivating Battle Tower like thing (there's something similar, but it's not quite as fun, and it can be done throughout the game), there's no captivating new area (once again, there is a new area, but it can be torn through rather quickly without much to do in it), and there aren't many people you can rebattle.

2. There is NO vs seeker or method to fight the trianers you have battle before like previous pokemon game.
3. Enemy Pokemon are much stronger than yours unless your really take time into the game to EV train them. 4. Once you beat the elite four the first time there is a MAJOR level gap when you beging to travel to the next town. A 20 level difference to be exact, which mean time to grind for 20 levels all your pokemon. (Not fun imo) 5. It seems that the makers of pokemon are running out of ideas in making new pokemon, some that where released just look ridiculous 2 of weirdest i've seen are #568 which is a garbage bag pretty much  and #618 which looks like a fish who was run'd over by a truck.

Animating the Pokemons was an absolutely superb idea that should have been implemented before, and the fact that TMs can be reused, which makes planning strategies much easier, was just the icing on the cake. Complete with very good music, and a storyline which may be not oscar-winning but does it job well, and also playing with more ""mature"" themes while keeping the core well preserved, this game is a must have for Nintendo DS owners and Pokemon fans alike.

First off people might think the graphics are great for a Pokemon game, but I didn't think it looked that much different than Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. Everything in this game is in 3D, except for 1 thing, YOU. I just think that Nintendo should take more risks in these games because in each new installments the only thing I find better is graphics(slightly), maybe combat and te menus. There was only really 1 thing that I liked in this game and that was the unlimited use of TMs which I found quite useful. The one thing that really bothered me was that in the first Pokemon games you only had to collect 150/151 Pokemon to fill the Pokedex which was hard enough as is, but now to fully complete the Pokedex you have to collect over 600. I just think that Pokemon has gone too far with the series. Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Fire Red, Leaf Green, Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald were all great, but after that I found it was the same game with a new coat of paint.

Ok the story is good and questions where you bring harm to your army of cute fire breathing badge getters, but just who is this game really for? While the rating says everybody is game aimed at the old fans or the young kids who may not be old enough to care and just want to catch strange looking creatures. While I'm 20 and while I liked the plot I though they could have pushed it farther. However my real issues lie within some the other things the game does. The C-Gear is my biggest pet peeve as I missed the useful menu thing Soul Silver had that made use of the bottom screen apposed to some online thing you will rarely use. Well if you have a lot friends who play this then it has some use but once again whose buying this game? I know more people my own age who have this apposed to kids but I have no life.  As the for the new Pokemon I don't care for them much with the exception **** type. The game seems unbalanced since if you pick the fire pig you can basically pat your self on the back since most of the Pokemon you will encounter will be weak to moves the pig will learn.  While I thought it was nice that you can't resort to old favorites till you beat the game once. I liked the fact the levels were higher too so you can't just wipe out your foes with ease though the new music that plays when your health hit the red zone is really annoying. It's also annoying how they took out most of the neat stuff from Soul Silver such a gym leader rematches, the phone system (still in need of work). The world just feels like a closed off island. But they did finally make TM's unlimited so you could use a move more than once. In general I'm not how to look at this game, personally I think there should be a game that reaches out to the older players instead of trying to jumble the old and the young players. Until then I think for people like me Pokemon will stay as a kitchen sink game, the kind you play to waste time till class starts."

I love how the pokemon keep moving after battle. I played pokemon platinum after i finished this, and i kept thinking, ""why aren't you moving?"" It grows on you! The legendaries were good, but i think they are repeating a little with the 3 musketeers as dog-like creatures. If they aren't dogs, they looks awful close to them. The graphics got a lot better, that i liked. To be honest and short, the game was great from all the new features (including the dream word!), but it is still pokemon, and pokemon needs to expand, not just stay slow, turn-based combat.

Pros: The use of 2-D sprites in a 3-D overworld is stunning, but the depth in level design is just mind-blowing; variety of Pokemon to catch, items to find, and moves to learn; lots of extras/secrets; fantastic multiplayer value. Cons: Formulaic gameplay; some ridiculous dialogue; some of the Pokemon designs are uglier than ever."

  ",9,"Definitely a large step up from the last Pokemon game, Pokemon Diamond & Pearl, which in my opinion were the worst of the mainstream Pokemon games published by Game Freak. These games mildly explore a variety of new ideas, such as cutscenes and the expansive Castelia City.
I disliked many of the new pokemon released in this game, although there are also many hidden gems which showcase the true talent of Game Freak.
This game has definitely persuaded me to stick with Game Freak for at least one more (hopefully spectacular) instalment in the Pokemon games."

  ",9,"I have played the Pokemon games ever since Red and Blue, and I can honestly say this is the best game since Pokemon Gold/Silver. The graphics, while not superb, are a lot better with 3d environments and the sprites of the Pokemon actually do something. The gameplay is unchanged, but that is not a bad thing. I mean its worked so far. The story is actually the best ever in the series. I actually felt at some points that these guys meant business, and they had goals that seemed logical. They didn't include drowning the world with a Kyogre because they like water or something like that. The game is actually very story driven, but that doesn't mean it is linear by any means. Something that is very welcome to the series is the idea that every Pokemon you encounter before the E4 is a new Pokemon. I did not encounter a single Geodude in my entire playing, and it was grand. I honestly could not put the game down for the first two weeks of my purchasing it, it is that much fun. The online capabilities are also drastically improved, now with the ability to do random matches against players and trade with random people, not just put up a Pokemon for auction. The only downside to the game is many of the new designs are hideous, and I don't say that lightly. I saw an ice cream cone and a pile of garbage, which was what was going through my mind when I saw the designs. Now that doesn't mean they all ****, on the contrary, many are excellent. Some of my new favorites such as Sawsbuck and Krookodile are some of the coolest looking Pokemon to date. I just feel that Gamefreak was more intent on quantity (156 new Pokemon), rather than quality when it came to the designs. That being said, many of these designs grew on me by the end of the game, and it really didn't detract that much from the enjoyment of the game. Pokemon Black is arguably the best in the series, and is a great way to get back into the series."

  ",10,"Absoloutely astounding. Whatever some reviewers may say about Pokemon Black not showing any new way for Pokemon, I don't think it needs a brand new developement, slight additions to the game each time adds new fun each time. Although it's not brand new, the great graphics which are used in Castelia City are amazing, some (ok lots) of the pokemon are dodgy and have slightly (ok very) unusual names, but that is not worthy of knocking a mark of it. I give it 10 here, but if i was marking it out of 100%, I would give it 95%. 2% off for not being completely new, 2% off for a few dodgy pokemon, and 1% off for few legendaries. But, that aside, brilliant!"

Black gave me that sense of depth and team customization that I hadn't had since Blue. Until you beat the Elite Four, all the Pokemon you encounter are new. Every fresh face you meet, you wonder ""How well would this guy fit into my team? Does he have any good moves? Who would he replace?"" The team combinations seem endless as you progress through the story. The story itself is pretty engaging, but not much to talk about. It's unfortunate that the Pokemon Global Link is down for maintenance until March 30th. I would've really liked to have this game feature available at launch. Another nitpick is that they removed the auto-run option from HeartGold/SoulSilver."

BUT
The main thing wrong with this game is what they decided not to use from SoulSilver and HeartGold, gone is the really useful menu on the touch screen, and you can't have pokemon following you. The touch screen is instead replaced with the Cgear, which currently, does nothing at all.
The storyline is a lot better than previous games, and some of the new pokemon are pretty cool though.
All in all, it's pokemon but with better looks and a worse menu than SS/HG."

There are a massive amount of pokemon to catch, loads of trainers to fight, loads of fighting methods, new moves, new abilities, the new region and of course the 2.5D view which works amazingly well. There are some breathtaking visuals with amazing cut scenes. There's also the ability to transfer pokemon from the older games making completing your pokedex a lot more easier.

  ",9,"I never thought the Pokemon series could get this good. I really couldn't. With Nintendo releasing the same tried and tried and tried and true formula over and over again on all it's portables, I thought that the best of the series would always be Pokemon Silver/Gold on the Gameboy Color. Boy, am I wrong.

Pokemon Black/White follows the same story as the other Pokemon games. You're a young boy/girl without a dad that goes off on a quest to catch all those adorable and dangerous critters we all know and love. You've got your rivals, your evil teams and your 8 gym battles that culminate in you going to the Pokemon League and facing off against the Elite 4. Same old, same old. Pokemon Black/White, however, tweaks these story elements a little. Instead of one rival who may or may not be a total ****, you've got 3 rivals, all with distinct personalities. Bianca is the airhead with the heart of gold, Cheren is the know-it-all kind of guy who ISN'T an arrogant **** and N is the wierdo that can ""hear what your Pokemon say"" (And who also may or may not be the leader of an evil organization.) These characters feel alot more fleshed out than previous rivals in the series. They've got goals, and different ways of getting to those goals. Previous rivals' personalities consisted of ""I'm better than you. Let's fight. Oh **** you're better. I'm gonna go away and be better than you so we can fight again."" It's a welcome change that I love.

The evil teams that always appear in Pokemon games also got a positive change in Black/White. Team Plasma actually has a somewhat legitimate  reason for wanting to take everyone's Pokemon. They're trying to release them from their trainers so they can all live together in balance. It made me think about the ethics of Pokemon treatment. Should we be stuffing adorable fuzzies into tiny, little balls and have them fight for fame and glory? Yeah, we should. Those guys are wrong. I'm right. Still, Team Plasma does seem like a well conceived evil group. They have a cult-like feel to them, which is a change from other Pokemon games.

The gym leaders are YET ANOTHER welcome change. Instead of being random people with crazy hair/crazy clothes/crazy personalities that just stand around at the end of their respective gyms doing nothing but wait for challengers, the gym leaders in Black/White take an active role in the story. Burgh, the third city's gym leader, helps the player out against a Team Plasma plot based in the third city. These little encounters give the gym leaders a little more character, and make them feel like actual people, instead of just obstacles for the player to overcome to get those freakin' badges.

Finally, the namesake Pokemon. 150 completely new Pokemon. Thank you, Nintendo. No more Wurmples, Pidgeys or GOD DAMN ZUBATS. Every Pokemon you encounter in Black/White is completely new. Granted, some of the newbies are quite ugly. But hey! New Pokemon! Gotta love it.

The battle system is nothing new. A few new inclusions include Triple Battles, which are Double Battles but with another Pokemon thrown in, and Rotation Battles, which are pretty much single battles with the active Pokemon being swapped out for another every turn. A few new moves here and there, and done.

Graphics wise, Pokemon Black/White is a stunner. Sweeping camera angles, lovely weather effects and improved overworld character sprites. Also, the Pokemon actually ANIMATE during battles. Dear god, this made my day for me. Seeing an enemy Snivy cross it's arms and look smug during a battle was totally awesome. Don't ask me why, it ****. A downside to the combat's visuals? Still no move animations. When I use Tackle, I expect my Pokemon to...tackle the enemy. Jutting forward slightly and adding an explosion sprite onto the enemy Pokemon does not equal a Tackle.

All in all, Pokemon Black/White is a fantastic Pokemon game. I dare say it's the best Pokemon game, next to Gold/Silver. Outstanding visuals, improved combat and no more god damn Zubats. Worth a buy."

  ",10,"Pokemon Black/White is, arguably, the best Pokemon game to date.
Fully utilizing the DS's somewhat limited power capabilities, Pokemon Black/White does an excellent job of creating a realistic, breathing world filled with Pokemon on Nintendo's handheld.
The 2.5D graphics are brilliant, and some of the bridge landscapes (you'll see what I mean when you play it) are truly phenomenal. The battle system is much improved; combat works faster, somehow, and the new animations for the Pokemon make the battles more interesting. However, for some baffling reason the Pokemon that you are using is just a blown up version of a smaller image, so it appears really pixelated, which I don't understand why the developers didn't do something about. Other than that though, the battle system is brilliant and triple and rotation battles add a breath of fresh air to the tried and true formula, the latter even encouraging more tactical thinking.
Then there are the Pokemon - around 150 new Pokemon, meaning that for the majority of the game you won't see a Pokemon that you recognise. Although some of them look stupid, it is extremely refreshing not to walk into a cave and be assaulted by a Zubat. The story is also far more mature than the other Pokemon games, with the game's villians (Team Plasma) even dealing with quite a tough moral issue, which I won't spoil in this review.
Basically, if you have read this far, GO AND BUY THE GAME. I have hardly put it down since I got it, and I have been carrying my DS everywhere with me so that, at any chance I get, I can dive right into the world of Pokemon."

  ",7,"Unfortunately, it seems Game Freak still hasn't worked out a few kinks in the Pokemon design. Like the previous generation, Pokemon Black and White play at a snail pace. Your walking speed is atrocious and you're stuck with it until you're given the running shoes. I don't understand this design choice at all. Why disallow us from running in the first place? I've always found this to be a nonsensical milestone to meet in the games.

Most actions and events are unnecessarily slow too. Transitioning from one scene to another (such as entering/exiting a building or a battle) still takes too long. Battle phases are still too drawn out as well. It should not take so long to show the attack you've used, the damage it has done and any multipliers or effects applied to it. This could all be remedied by simply showing all relevant information above the rival Pokemon (a la most RPGs), rather than the usual text boxes at the bottom of the screen.

The new Pokemon are better than I expected, to be fair. I'd seen a lot of the official art of these new Pokemon a while ago and I was not impressed. Fortunately, as sprites, they look a little less hideous. Still, I consider them to be pretty weak compared to earlier generations (I didn't think much of Generation IV's new Pokemon either), but that could be nostalgia clouding my judgement.

The story in this generation is slightly darker and more complex than the series has ever seen before, which is a nice touch. There are themes in this game I wouldn't have ever expected to see in the series and I'm glad they're there. In terms of story, this generation is far ahead of anything before it. However, don't expect to be enthralled by it - this is still a Pokemon game.

I was hoping for more change in these games, honestly. I wasn't expecting these changes (I imagine straying from the proven formula too much could prove hazardous), but they would have been nice. That's about all I've got to say, really."

Sure they have their flaws such as mostly weird pokemon and then no pokemon following behind you any more. The good out weights the bad by far however. Zekrom and Reshiram and awesome. Axew and its family are wickedly powerful. The graphics are nice but the chamera is not as good as others were saying it was. In the end however I found both to be great games even if they could have come up with mostly better pokemon. I give the games a 9/10 overall.

There are 150 new Pokemon, and while they are well... odd to say the least, it sure is kind of cool to see nothing but new creatures every time I get into a random battle. I like the camera angle here, it is really well done, and does a good job of implementing the 2.5D capability of the DS. Multiplayer... oh wow, they really created something else. The entire multiplayer experience is overhauled, with a feature similar to the 3DS' street-pass, a Pokemon dream world, and no more freaking Pokemon Centers to connect wirelessly. C-Gear is outstanding. I once rated HG a 9, but Black (and I suppose I can speak for White too), is so much more streamlined, improved, and fresh. I would call this among the top 10 DS games of all time."
