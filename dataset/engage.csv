  ",2,"Overwhelmingly unbalanced. The plot is neat but most of the good stuff is locked behind battles that feel like total slogs without grinding, and the game disincentivizes grinding pretty hard. I find myself going through all my rewinds without getting any progress done at a certain point and I have to redo everything because a generic rolled a hit on a 20% hit chance that does way more damage than it should at that point in the game. I'm not playing on Maddening, why am I getting an experience that's roughly on par with that?"

  ",5,"I couldn't even get past chapter 10 before I already dropped this game to play a new game + on Three Houses. The battles are still good fun don't get me wrong, I think the combat/animations in this game are a step above and take a lovely turn toward more traditional fire emblem with fun and interesting mechanics, The Emblems are cool, the good kind of implimentation of a ""gimmick"", they also just allow for more depth in unit customization, all that is great.
But the story and most noncombat gameplay here is lackluster at best, all the characters are just tropes or caricatures of a better character, flanderized to hell and back. And all the supports are just... they're nothing sandwiches with extra cringe.
What Happened? They try so hard to do kinda what Three Houses was doing but completely miss the mark, and even the point, with a lot of these mechanics. The Somniel wants to be the Monistary so bad but it isn't even CLOSE to being as fleshed out, There's very little to do in comparison except run around talking to boring ass NPC's or pick up trash like a bum, maybe do squats and buy ****, arena fights are a cool addition though. Being able to pick units to fight against one another and gain EXP, that includes Emblems as well. But its so barebones, it has all the heart the Monstary had stripped out and now its just a lame hub world. I stopped watching the supports, they were so, so bad. All of them, and I mean all of them, act like 12 year olds, its so mindnumbing to watch they brainless characters interact. A real **** shame since those used to be one of my favorite parts of Fire Emblem. All in all what do I think? Well I'll just ask ""Are these the same guys"" and ""Wha Happun"""

  ",6,The story is definitely lacking in depth and development. It’s pretty barebones and at times I was wanting to skip it. The gameplay during the battles definitely makes it a more than playable game. It’s fun to use different character combos and battle the corrupted. It does get a bit repetitive. Overall it’s a fun game but it leaves a lot to be desired.

The characters are underdeveloped and fall apart in their inconsistent designs. All interesting aspects for the characters are not explored enough.
I have to agree that it's a downgrade from three houses.

The combat system was fun but that's about it. Also sad that there was a gigantic cast and you had to bench a lot of them."

My biggest issue, it takes forever to get good. They should have immediately started with the good gameplay parts 1st. The story is meh for the most part.

My 2nd biggest issue, I spend more time micromanaging and in submenus. Which it can be fun in games like Xcom, but you have to be careful of how you do it. Especially if your game has slow load screens.

Lastly and minor annoyance. I can't believe this game doesn't have any touch screen function. They added some ease of life functions, but excluding that was weird.

PS: it does have a online mode, is compatible with amiibos, has auto optimization options, and a autobattle function (which should go faster)."

- Story: I played all the 3DS-era games and 3H. The story and romance are what keep the game engaging. Here, they threw them all away. That is a disappointment. 
- Design: The character design is a step-down. Seriously. You look at all the characters; all are goofy, child-like, and too colorful - not suitable for battle or have the charm of the previous games.

I love the old Fire Emblem titles but that doesn't mean I want those old characters regurgitated again and again in lazy ways. Fates was the first Fire Emblem to bore me - I enjoyed Shadow Dragon - and Engage is now the second. The engage mechanic - ripped straight from #FE - works fine as a quasi-Persona mechanic but doesn't add that much over Awakening's pair up. The only appeal of this title is the strategy but even there its subpar compared to other titles in the series. Very disappointing anniversary celebration and a lackluster follow-up to Shadows of Valencia and Three Houses."

Gameplay: 8/10
Graphics: 7/10
Music: 5/10
Enjoyment: 5/10

My first Fire Emblem was Sacred Stones, and I've played all of them since the GBA and onward. This one feels like the weakest link and it's not even close. I'd like to add, I don't hate modern Fire Emblem games. Three Houses was a thoroughly enjoyable game to me with interesting character interactions despite some parts being a bit contrived. Engage felt like it failed to convey any real character depth, had an extremely cut and pasted story with inconsistent story beats.

I will admit though, there were some redeemed points in some areas of the combat. Despite it being a modern FE game with easy power leveling, which nullifies the challenge, (if you're looking for that) it delivers some things that are a nice inclusion like the action Break mechanic, and the Engage system. Engages are very busted however, showing a severe lack of balancing of the game.

If you're looking for a Fire Emblem game, this game may scratch that itch at its bare minimum. If you like tactical RPGs and haven't played a FE game, you may find this game quite fun. Though if you're a longtime FE player, this one is likely to feel like a new low in almost every regard."

  ",5,"Fire Emblem Engage is an example of only the core gameplay that cannot save the game if anything else goes in the wrong direction. Firstly, while I hate to judge some subjective topics like Character Art and Story. I feel like this element is really dragging the game down, they cannot support gameplay elements at all. While the character design is okay for me, the story is really bland, and repetitive, and reduces the variety of bosses in gameplay. Friendship conversation is also not as well made as Three Houses since it is divided into rings too.
Secondly, while the core gameplay is great and challenging more than Three Houses, The balance in this game is really bad. This game forces you to bench the old one and use the new unit instead.  While I love variants of classes in this game. Classes are also not balanced. In the end, you must pick only the one that can make it to the endgame.
Finally, the UX in this game is really bad. You need a lot to traverse through an area to get a little thing done such as obtain skills. However, Patch already fixes that.
In summary, I think 5 doesn't mean it is totally bad but it is 50% good and 50% bad, which is a shame."

  ",10,"This game is an hidden masterpiece: if the player completes the game on the difficulty of their desire: the tactical gameplay is the best in the SPRG genre. 
I spent 240 hours tinkering around with different strategies, the music in this game that accompanies the combat is very pretty and suits perfectly for hours of mind-full strategies. 
Overall this game is my third favourite JRPG on Switch after Fire Emblem Three Houses and Xenoblade 2&3.
Fe engage, is a pure example of strategies meeting the JRPG genre.
the result: a masterpiece, don't be put of from negative reviews of this game, as with Xenoblade 2, it has its haters; mainly due to the so called Japanophile-arch types of these games.

Fire Emblem Engage is my own GOTY for 2023.

Some characters are very well designed. (There are at least several characters that I am very fond of).
I surprisingly am very fond of Male Alear, I thought, Brandon McInnis, did a superb job bringing out his kind and caring personality.
Also the Emblem Rings work so damn well.
The soundtrack is stunning too.

Cons: weak worldbuilding, some characters have personalities that aren't that well developed, the dlc appears to have been rushed, no new game plus. Fire Emblem engage had so much more potential with the whole dragon lore and so on, it appears the devs, rushed some vital aspects of this game.

Just hope Nintendo will make the next Fire Emblrem, in the spirit of old classics and also hire an high-quality artist with talent similar to the  art-styles, found in the Tellius era of Fire-Emblem."

  ",1,"This is a resurgence the worst Fire Emblem has to offer. They forgot everything they did right in Three Houses. The prior entry to FE3H was FE Fates which was slammed for being unoriginal with a terrible story, characters, and just shoehorned mechanics from better games before it. FE Engage was written by the same guy and it shows. Only difference is instead of cramming the mechanics from prior games in they just cut them out entirely. This is an anniversary game so nobody thought it'd be good but charging full price for this game is predatory. 

Want a good FE experience? Play Three Houses. Want more? Play FE9&10? Not enough GBA games and Awakening.

Only ever play this game if you're hooked on anime and strategy RPGs and can forgive terrible story, characters, and gameplay elements. Then play every other game in the genre before buy this one at a very generous sale price.

  ",3,"Just for content; I only played Fire Emblem games since the 3DS era. My first was Three houses though, which is still to date is my favourite game as I loved the story and the character development. 
Now for Engage… lets start with the good; Game play (as many other people stated before) is one of the best. I don’t care for the emblem rings, it became confusing when more than one unit was engaged on the map and I couldn’t distinguish who was whom, but other than that was ok. Love the return of the weapon triangle and the fact that they removed weapon durability. Art style is nice, but I don’t really care for it either. As long as there is a good and engaging (pun intended) story, they can be stick figures for all I care. That’s where my disappointment with Engage comes into place. The “story” (if I call it that…). It feels like a 5 year old wrote it. I never thought there would be a worse story than Fates but here we are. At least in Fates the support conversations were ok (some even enjoyable). In engage after 40 hours I just skipped them. I benched the first 2 characters from the start (cant remember their names, the twins or something). They were just sooo annoying. I benched them after the 100th time I hear the phrase “Divine dragon”. I just couldn’t take it anymore. I’ve seen that only 1 person wrote the whole story and supports for this game, which is a huuuuge task, but WHY ON EARTH would you give this task to the same person who wrote Fates’ story???? You knew already how poorly that game was received because of it’s story. WHY???

In every FE game the main thing is permadeath which makes you think twice and it adds to the suspense, but it only adds to the gameplay if you actually care about loosing your units. I didn’t care for them, so if they dies, well tough s****, I just moved on to the next one.  The menus and inventory management are (or at least was, not sure if they patched it) annoying; you need to travel between locations between loading screens just to check what skills a character has, or what you need to get it, then go to another location, duel, get those gems and go back and get the skill.
Music in this game also annoyed me. I love the soundtrack in every Fire Emblem I played, but this one I had to mute. Its just my taste though, but I still listen to 3H’s music to this day. I bought the Collectors edition of this game as I do with every FE game (heck I even have all the limited edition stuff from Fates as I liked Conquest’s maps) but I wish I just bought the normal one or didn’t buy it at all.

So just to summarise;

GOOD/OK

Gameplay
-Art style
-Weapon Triangle
-No kids (it was really overwhelming and Pokemon-like collect them all in Fates and Awakening)

MISSING / BAD

-STORY (or the lack of it)
-Character development
-Music
-End-story cards after beating the game like in 3H. I really liked this little touch just to know what happened to the characters (well…. Didn’t really care for these characters, but hope they will bring it back in future entries)

I really hope this is not where the franchise is going with future entries. Hoping the developers can check this site as the scores are not as great as they were/are with 3H. This game is a HUUUGE step back from Three Houses. Even from Fates…"

  ",10,"Fire Emblem Emgage is an awesome Turn based tactical RPG that continues to amaze all these years later. I also must give a shout-out to Intelligent Systems for their awesome music team. They also did music for games like Warriorware. Their chord progression and dreamy orchestral feel for Fire Emblem never ceases to amaze and I must talk about that too. Tithe game’s got something for the casual and hard core vet players as well which makes it a welcome addition to my collection.     The story is great to go along with it to boot. You okay the Divine Dragon in human form of course and you gather your forces together from different kingdoms across the land to prepare for a strategic fight of epic proportions against the Evil Dragon.      Mostly every character you come across in the game you can have on your team. I call this the Goku approach. It gives you something to look forward to, and I can say I like it a lot!      To me the game for multiple reasons is hard to dislike because they stick to the formula and along with that they give you all the older characters via Spirits from the Engage Character Rings. Marth is the first one you start with but it steadily expands to other characters from past FE games.       They even are doing DLC where more characters via rings and bracelets are available as well. You have a home base called Somniel floating in the sky. There is where lots of things go down. You can train characters and teach them new techniques from the rings they have with bond fragment points which are earned in a number of ways.      You can increase bonds with characters by doing all sorts of things together other than battling. You can increase bonds with characters and the engage rings/bracelets too.      It wouldn’t be Fire Emblem without classic permadeath and it’s there if you want it. It’s so funny if the main character dies he will still be alive for the story but he’s never with you in battle. So technically from a gameplay standpoint even the main character isn’t exempt from permadeath if you so choose that option.       Every character is well written and thought out and the interactions with each other is priceless. It was nice to see character diversity. They do a very good job with that. I dare say that Japan is better at marking dark/brown skin characters than most American games and that says a lot.       That’s one of the reasons they will always have my support, plus their games are just so fun! It’s hard to not like them! The music!!!! Oh My God! The music is absolutely banging on this game from the orchestral arrangements to how the best kicks in when things get serious in battle. From your side to the enemies side when it’s their turn to fight.      You can even control what music comes on how often and on which side during combat! I love little things like that! The game overall is incredibly fun and the DLC is very worth it. For me it was the first time for most of these characters.      Sadly the only ones I knew were Marth and Roy way back from Super Smash Bros. Melee. I of course got educated from the amount of other games and lore out there eventually, but I love how the game has these characters in there and shows their significance!     I give Fire Emblem Engage a 10/10! Absolutely amazing and I almost forgot to mention the animations and facial expressions of the characters were amazing and felt so real, you could feel for them and their struggles. I recommend it to anyone and everyone! A must buy for one’s RPG collection! Peace and happy gaming!"

The story is fine outside of a rough start and some cringe moment The characters are fun and enjoyable and after playing it every other FE has bland design in comparison The combat animations are absolutely fantastic they have impact on them like no other game and seing a cavalier go through a fence(because there was a fence on the map) before hitting someone will never stop looking good, there is also customized animations for every niche situations like fighting in stairs for example, sometimes instead of dodging an arrow it will be deflected and a dodges follow well into counterattacks I also love the art style and how the overall world look its colorful and pleasant to look at"

  ",2,"My review didn't work, so I lost everything I wrote, thus I'll try to keep this succinct. For reference, I've been playing Fire Emblems for nearly a decade, since Awakening and unironically think that this is the worst Fire Emblem I've even played. Even moreso than Fates.

Story is strange, overly childish. Too many child soldiers, the cutesy aesthetic and how 'adorable' it tries to be clashes with previous games, which have always added a layer of depth and ominous themes, which while not being blatant enough to scare a child, could be enjoyed by mature audiencese. New and improved characters appear in every scene, causing you to become completely apathetic to their lore and stories. I've heard that the combat is amazing, but I disagree, it feels like it's downgraded. Moving throughout the terrain is clunky and each battle goes through the identical trope of, ""Click engage, wipe out an enemy, repeat"", being so tedious that it feels worse than its predecessors. There's also some weirdo character who is male, yet dresses up like a 'girl' and enjoys 'cute' things because he was groomed or something in youth. For a game that tries so hard to be cutesy and childish, it's just odd. Overall, stick with Awakening."

  ",8,I played this game about 30 Hours so far. Really good mechanics and I like the Engage rings it adds more fundamentals to what character or teammates. The story really falls off when you lose Hero marth and the others. Really reminds me of the red wedding since half the rings are in captivity and the daughter of the main antagonist is now on your side. The side activities are just like three houses but the game design and are much better in your base than the previous one. The battle layout however feels quirky but the game really isnt all that bad. Alear is a great protagonist and at first i didn't like the design but the character felt more in tune than byleth in three houses.

  ",7,"FE Engage has the difficult task to come out after Three Houses, which was the first very succesful FE game in the west. Many people that liked 3H might not enjoy Engage as much – while FE veterans are more than happy about the amazing tactic gameplay it offers

The story and writing is the weakest point here, with the main story being super tropy, nothing special and just a very basic narrative. Good writing comes through in the funny and interesting support conversations that bring a lot of color to the characters.

The art style is extremely colorful, might be a bit to comicy for some. The game itself looks amazing though.

The shining star is definitely the gameplay, which is absolute peak turn based strategy combat. There is a vast variety of unit types so that each playthrough is unique. The Emblem Rings offer eve more tactic options as each Emblem offers special abilities.

The Somniel as a hub fulfills its purpose, but there are many activities that just feel annoying, with little rewards, like „polishing your Emblem Rings“ or wyvern riding. Those boring side activities could be removed to put more focus on other aspects as they offer little to none to the game itself."

The graphics look amazing, even though the artstyle is controversial, I liked it. Emblems are fun to use and need a lot of calculation to be used efficiently. The OST is great and the battle animations have never been better. The Somniel is a way better feature than the monastery, since you aren't forced to be there in 50% of your gametime like in Three Houses. The new Characters on the other hand feel kinda boring and Supports aren't great. You can really feel that the Gameplay was made by people who love Fire Emblem. The Story and the characters however, are not."

As I as had much the combat mechanics of this than I did with the last 2 games.  But one thing for this game is not a 6/10 game it’s definitely a 8/10 game. Also worth noting is that the game has a good cast it just introduces most of the boring party members/Units first before moving on the the more introducing the more better written meme era of the cast towards the middle of the game. Honestly I recommend this game and I think it a solid jrpg and a good addition to the legacy of the fire emblem franchise just go in not expecting much from the narrative prepare yourself for some fun and challenging battles.

Visually it improves and the battles continue to have the essence of the Fire Emblem. everything else, history, progress, level of customization, charisma of the characters is mediocre. The ring system doesn't work and is poorly implemented, it seems more like an excuse to bring back characters from the past.

The game relies on massive reinforcements in almost every map to create tension (in a way no other fire emblem game I played did) but it becomes boring very quickly and horribly worsens the experience. The original fire emblem characters are not always respected in their characterization (expecially Eirika) and they managed to make all their conversations boring and Lyn's paralogue map isn't even from her game. Also the lack of paired endings is something that extremely disappointed me.

Reducing ability slots to only two would be fine if abilities as a whole were much more impactful in battle, and while this can be said for some, there are many that are useless or just not worth investing your precious SP in. They missed the mark with this one, but it’s an interesting idea.

The story is boring and uninteresting–4’th grade level stuff–the writing is fine, and the main player character design is just embarrassing.

The game itself also feels lacking in content and perhaps a touch too easy, because I’m blasting through chapters and already at the halfway point. With no alternate paths or endings to look forward to, there’s pretty much no reason to replay this game beyond bumping up the difficulty and trying out different characters–but when the core of what’s there is so utterly average and uninspiring, I don’t see myself doing this.

Engage is a massive step backwards from 3 Houses and doesn’t inspire confidence in the future of this franchise. Go back to your roots, hire some good writers, and stop trying to appeal to a casual audience that isn’t ever going to manifest for this genre of game."

  ",5,"So, I've played just about every Fire Emblem game at this point, excluding spinoffs like Warriors/Three Hopes/Heroes, so I'd like to think that I've got some pretty hefty experience in the franchise. My favorites? FE6 (Binding Blade)/FE9 (PoR)/FE15 (Shadows of Valentia). Simple, yet masterfully crafted games that challenged the player to the limit with tightly tuned base mechanics wrapped together with small twists to the formula to keep it fresh. They contain soundtracks that invade my brain to this day without my permission. They had a solid story (with their share of hiccups, mind you) that kept me engaged throughout, with a very likeable cast of misfits and lords. They had proper worldbuilding and set the stage properly, making the continent actually feel alive. Practically every unit was serviceable, with some being clearly better than others, but with just about every unit having a purpose/niche use. Frankly, I still play several of these games today, 10+ years after their release.

Why am I bringing up other FE games so much? To drive home how lackluster Engage is. Now while Engage was an improvement over Three Houses in gameplay and map design, it did worse in just about every other meaningful category. From resource management, to character design, to character supports, to skill balancing, to character balancing, to sound design/OST, to story design, to the scale of the villains/antagonists, everything else just falls flat.

In other words, Engage is a disappointment. Despite having polished gameplay and beautiful animation sprinkled throughout, it is so bafflingly horrendous at just about everything else that I have lost interest in playing the game. Solid gameplay is a must for Fire Emblem, but even the worst game in the franchise has been serviceable in that regard. A diamond will be a diamond, regardless of its polish/features. Instead, it is the overall presentation that gives the diamond its allure. In other words, Engage lacks a proper soul, something to draw me into it and keep me, heh, engaged. I am also of the opinion that this game simply has too many mechanics drowning what is otherwise solid gameplay. The Somniel (however you spell it) and all of its gimmicks alone makes the game feel like such a chore at times.

TLDR; Engage has a few strong points, but overall it is a disappointment to the FE franchise, and a huge step down from the previous installments: Three Houses and Shadows of Valentia. If looking for a FE game on the switch, I would personally recommend skipping this one, and would suggest Three Houses instead. I love Fire Emblem, it is my favorite video game franchise, but Engage was simply not for me. Hopefully the rumored remake of FE4 will wash the bad taste out of my mouth."

There's a complete hesitation to buy this game and that's why I just borrow it from my friend and I'm glad I didn't purchase it, I don't like it that well. This game is far inferior that Three Houses. To put into a context: Three Houses is my first fire emblem game and I've also finished Engage, so this is not half experience review as I've encounter every content this game has to offer.

The visuals and cutscene of this game is an improvement than the last installment but it also becoming it's weaknesses as well. The cutscene is way too lengthy, believe it or not, the cutscene could take around 10-15 minutes. Completely kill the pacing of this game. I skip every cutscene after Chapter 12 (excluding the cinematic cutscene).
Another note from the cutscene or art department, the animation is still lacking like in Three Houses and the interaction also hella weird. You can have a normal conversation after the battle with your enemy before they flee. Makes no sense and kill the tension that should be there.

The game is way more free in terms of time because there's no Day Mechanic like in Three Houses so you can grind and bond as much as you want where in Three Houses you need to plan out how to utilize several days in a month. Sounds great right? Turns out, it's a nope.
Because of that freedom, the game get tedious pretty fast. Engage couldn't handle it well, the skirmishes will always get generated for you to grind. It's great but for me it becomes annoying as I'm trying to clean the map from those bandits but we'll never be able to clean that out. Exploring around the Somniel also get boring pretty quickly. There's no real value or meaningful activities there. The fact that you can skip going back to Somniel and keep proceeding with the Chapter sort of make Somniel just an extra content.

The UI of the game is also confusing. One example: I miss the inheritance skill which I think it's auto equipped but turns out you need to press ZR in the inheritance skill to equip it. Completely a bad design.

The variety of the characters are nice and pretty good but they are truly forgettable, not like the way in Three Houses. Even in their combat abilities, they are also forgettable which makes me lock my unit to the one that I like the most from start to end which makes many characters like a filler for my roster. My Lineup will always consist of: Alfred, Celine, Louis, Ivy, Zelkov, Kagetsu, Alcryst, Panette and Merrin.

So many things holding this game down which is a shame as this game seems like an Anniversary game for Fire Emblem series but turns out to be a bummer. Luckily the combat is amazing and strategic which is way better than Three Houses."

First off the story is basically none existent, it's really just a black and white story, good guys vs inherently bad guys with next to no plottwists or anything interesting happening. The social aspect was heavily toned down, characters are paper cut walking cliches with no personality whatsoever. The overall maturity of 3H took a backseat and it's fates all over again, a whiny one dimensional protagonist who is just flat out boring. 3H protag was mute and had basically no personality but still was more appealing.  Also the game is heavily CENSORED by treehouse, whole conversation have been changed because they found them offensive.

In one support conversation a female character complains about gaining weight (she says that in japanese), the english text indicates she's embarrassed because she made a funny face while eating... It makes no sense at all and is plain right stupid. Thing is treehouse found a girl shouldn't be concerned with her weight so they changed that. It's just the tip of the iceberg, a lot more dialogue was altered.  The only thing this game has going are the smooth graphics and fun gameplay, but that gets old fast. After all the censorship, butchered dialogue, boring story and flat characters I couldn't finish it, I stopped at chapter 15. I have over 300hrs on 3H because I loved this game to bits. engage on the other hand is an embarrassment, and the people who censored it should never be allowed to translate any kind of Japanese game again."

  ",0,"As a huge fan of the Fire Emblem series, this was an extremely disappointing entry. Here are the points I disliked the most:
-Progression system holds your hand too much, it's too much trouble to get a character out of their predetermined role/jobs, so customization is extremely limited unless you are willing to grind for it.
-Emblem rings are too powerful, even on harder difficulties.
-The story is incredibly bland, I am over 30 hours into this game and I literally couldn't care less about any of the dialogue.
-The story is very repetitive. Go to a new kingdom, add a prince or princess to your squad along with their two retainers, fight a few monsters, maybe get a new ring, then move on. There's no nuance.
-Whenever you get new characters, they simply outclass the ones you had before, meaning that the only unit that is even worth training at the very beginning is your main character. Literally everyone else will be replaced by stronger characters by the end of the game. Because of this, a bad progression system becomes completely useless.
-The animations are re-used between different characters during dialogue sections. Normally, this wouldn't bother me. But they literally have one ""girl animation set"" and one ""guy animation set"" that get re-used between literally everyone, and it becomes extremely tacky very quickly. They should have at least created 2-4 animation sets for each gender...
-The character personalities are incredibly bland. I didn't find myself connecting with nearly any of the characters like I have in previous games. Watching the character bond cutscenes in this one feels like a chore compared to previous games where I looked forward to every cutscene.
-They got rid of weapon durability for some reason. One of the best parts of Fire Emblem is managing your limited resources inside and outside of combat. Taking that away makes this game lose an entire dimension to combat and the underlying strategic choices you make.

Now, here are the things I liked about the game:
-The combat is ""don't broke, don't fix it"". It's pretty much the same as Fire Emblem Three Houses as far as the actual combat goes, so the combat itself is still pretty solid. Just too bad that everything influencing your character progressions is terrible.
-The graphics are actually pretty solid. I really liked the art and character designs in this game. It is really a shame that the story is so bad and the character personalities are so bland.

Overall, extremely disappointed with this one. It's still fire emblem, so it's not a ""bad"" game. But compared to other fire emblem games, this may be the worst of all time."

  ",7,"I started playing fire emblem during the gba era and I have to say, engage is a bit disappointing. It has plenty going for it, but as a whole misses the mark. The gameplay is really good, the return of the weapon triangle is very much welcome, and the rings do a lot to diversify gameplay. The visuals are much smoother and the maps in this game I feel are superior to that of three houses in terms of design both artistically and technically. I also really enjoyed the mini arena where the player could could set up duels amongst the cast of the main party for exp - I honestly hope that returns in future titles.

The social aspect has been toned down very much so from three houses, so anybody who wasn't a fan of the social aspect in that game may find themselves more at home with this title - this may be a good thing to some but also leads to my first complaint.

The character interactions outside of battle are so bland and abbreviated that their inclusion doesn't feel justified; on top of that, characters are completely forgettable anime arche types so I found myself caring about them far less than in previous titles. When the rest of the story is forgettable at best and downright boring at worst the player will have very little reason to delve any deeper into the story and character lore than what is necessary to progress and, sadly, that is how I felt when playing.

Other than the combat in Engage, the rest of the game is extremely mediocre. I honestly couldn't bring myself to finish it because it felt, as a whole, to be a stilted experience. It definitely has the DNA **** game but frankly it fails in too many areas to be considered as such. I think this game would have been much better received if it dropped before three houses but, coming afterward, this game feels like a complete downgrade to the previous title.

Also, a personal note, i think the main hero design is pretty atrocious as well. Byleth's design was far superior, giving us a classic looking king type from the series with very unique and cool clothing. The new hero just looks like a mess - i do understand that this is a subjective take but I had to mention it.

TLDR; the game has good combat and combat mechanics but not much more. It misses more than it hits."

Engage is much more light-hearted, and it shows with the characters depth (or lack thereof), art style, story, etc. This by itself is fine, if you want an experience different from 3 Houses.
Big events don't feel meaningful. When you learn about your character, it doesn't feel like it's earned. When important moments happen, they don't captivate me, because I hardly knew the characters to begin with. I don't think I regret buying this, but to me, it's a downgrade from Three Houses. I'd recommend someone to play that instead."

  ",5,"I have put two hundred hours into this game and played all the dlc maps. Through the shimmers of good gameplay, alright music, and a handful of memorable characters. I was left salty and burnt out by the end of it all. Like looking for that small, glimmer of light in the deepest, ocean abyss. I never found that hook to get me excited to play Engage. Instead, beating this game as close to a hundred percent as I could felt more like a chore than anything else. I won't drag on with how bad the story is since everyone is pretty much in agreement that it is horrible and uninspired. However, there are other things that I do think bring the game down. Especially after the fourth wave of dlc that I believe is worth talking about.

First, the avatar pandering needs to stop. When the trailer came out for the fourth wave. I never felt so uninterested, for a series of dlc waves that cost thirty five dollars, for a character I little give no diddily squats about. If it was Diamant, or Ivy, or Yunaka, or a few of my favorite others characters that wasn't the main one. I would definitely care a lot more. Although the four crown princess and princesses and their siblings get something. It is still completely overshadowed by the amount of screen time, pampering, and worshipping that Alear gets. I don't even think that is how emotions work. The evil clones in wave four such as Diamant, Alcrist, Ivy, etc had emotions that made sense for their predicament. Alear is still looked at as a god. A character that can never do no wrong. Even from their enemies, and this kind of writing seriously needs to stop. I believe every avatar since fates had this problem. I honestly hope that maybe after this. IS will consider dropping the avatar for a while. Then again, I asked for the same after Byleth, but Three Houses sold almost three million copies. So clearly, listening to feedback was not the priority after that game came out.

Next, the dlc. What a complete and utter load. The first three waves consist of nothing but new emblems and rare items which clearly should have been in the game day one. Even still, I hated doing most of these maps. Why do I hate them? It's because no fire emblem map should be thirty five turns or more. Are they insane!? To put that into perspective. I started Camillias map around seven at night. Pushing through and fighting wave after wave after wave of reinforcements using the Diamant and Ike emblem combo until I defeated the boss. By the time I was done. It was ten at night. I had been sitting there for three hours trying to get an emblem of a character that A. I did not like and B. Was completely useless through out my whole play through. What makes this more scummy is that there is no Hoshido rep. In an anniversary title meant to honor all the games. Conquest and Birthright being separate from each other. Besides, we all know why Camilla was chosen over Xander or Leo who actually went through an arc. Fan service, and it's not even good fan service. If IS made a game where you could actually play as past heros and expand on their lore and character development. That would be good fan service. Waving keys in front of our faces to hide your mistakes will only work for so long. Maybe, after the second or third try. IS might finally see this now...emphasis on might.

Lastly, and most importantly. Even after the dlc. After getting playable characters who died in the main story, and after getting new powers, uninspired story ideas, or whatever IS can conjure up. I am here to say on the record, right now. My soul be damned, that Conquest and Birthright had a overall better story than Engage. The main reason as to why is because those games at least had stakes. There was tension. When a character died in that game. They stayed dead. Engage has none of that. No one is really ever considered dead in this game. There is nothing to be lost. There is nothing to worry about. So why should a player be concerned about anything in this game? I actually miss the drama Corrin had between the Norh and Hoshido siblings despite the flaws those games had. I believe that drama between characters is what worked for three houses and is what's needed for the next game. Fire Emblem Engage didn't feel like an anniversary game to me. It was more so a series of underdeveloped ideas, wasted potential, and a overdone avatar character that you can't make to look like you anymore."

  ",7,"Fire Emblem Engage was a return to formula for the franchise, backpedalling on new ideas in favor of the traditional storytelling the series is known for. Fell Dragon bad guy, dragon child hero, and parents who proudly wear their death flags with pride as their kids join your party. As I worked my way through the 26 chapter narrative I was hopeful I would find some hook, some great plot twist to make this experience stand out from it's predecessors. And after logging in nearly 70 hours I can confidently say... There's nothing here we haven't seen before. The story was predictable to a fault with very little in the way of plot twists or surprises, and overstayed it's welcome by being unnecessarily long to tell a tale that was fairly straightforward. I know I've not played many Fire Emblem games as I started with the 3DS era, but I would go so far as to say this story was the weakest of any Fire Emblem game I've played.

The characters have interesting designs and fun personalities, but with a cast of nearly 40 characters you get so little time with any of them. Support conversations return and are a delight, but unless you’re willing to dedicate an insane amount of time to grinding you won’t be seeing even half of them the game has to offer. The main story eventually condenses the cast down to about 6 core characters and shelves most of the others along the way, which is a shame because many of them looked interesting and I would have liked to spend time with them. As is also the case with quantity over quality, many of the characters I did spend time with lacked depth and leave me with few I’ll remember.

Now to give credit where it's due, mechanically speaking this easily was an achievement in the franchise. The Emblem system greatly impacted every battle with a unique ultimate move of sorts characters could use to influence the tides of battles. They were as pleasing to watch the characters use as they were to actually put them into practice, with each one being dynamically different. This was only made more incredible by the fact that there are so many emblems each with a unique move and skill set that you always wonder what the next thing is you can do. Given that Engage is even in the name, I will say it delivered on that core feature.

Ultimately playing Fire Emblem Engage felt like playing Fire Emblem Fates Revelations, but without playing two journeys to lead up to the big adventure and just starting there instead. A cast too big to enjoy, a thin story that overstays it’s welcome, and an experience that’s overall forgettable. I’ll remember a few characters I liked, or some of the villains that had surprisingly more depth than most the heroes. I’ll remember how fun the game was to play, or how fantastic the soundtrack was. Overall I will remember that I enjoyed this game… but only just enough to say, “it was alright.”"

  ",3,"It is sad to see that Intelligent Systems approved a story and plot with the literary level of a fan hack. While certainly not all fire emblems are known for its story, they try to at the very least make it concise and try to make fun characters. This is a very sad fall from the subtleties the story had in the Tellius and Jugdral games. There is nothing worse than making nostalgic fan service integral to the story. The emblems don´t make sense.

Character designs feel soulless and generic, with no particular trait to make any character represent who they are through designs. The somniel doesn´t work as a hub area to expand or develop characters, only as a way to make half baked mechanics trying to emulate Garreg Mach in fire emblem three houses, most of the time however I get to the somniel and it feels like a chore checklist to be completed.

While gameplay wise the graphics, animations and map design have been improved over three houses, OP mechanics such as the emblem rings make it hard to feel the units as evenly distributed and balanced given that you don´t actually have a vast number of rings until the latter half of the game, I reached chapter 20 and stopped playing when I realized there was nothing compelling to keep on going other than the fact that I payed 60 bucks for this one.

I feel like this game was contaminated by the influence of the fire emblem heroes mobile game, entirely based on fan service. If you are going to charge me 60 dollars for this one, I expect a much more deep experience from the fire emblem main series."

  ",2,"Top 3 worst fire emblem. There is little strategy now, emblems are cool but they **** the skills aren't so powerful and I never used most special attacks because they were weaker than a normal attack.

Older games had some strategy, in this game you only have to run, because most maps have infinite reinforcement and that ****. I miss some things from previous games like secret shop, real coliseum... Mage got a downgrade, there is no mage triangle, now it's close and range. Almost every enemy use armor in this game so some characters with little damage are useless. Great weapons are not worth it, single attack are worse than double. I also dislike the break system, weapon triangle was ok there was no need for this break mechanic. I also dislike the extra life mechanic. You gotta kill 3 times some enemy and that doesn't add any difficulty just waste three units, a good fighting system wouldn't need it.

Final boss has 0% hit on my main character, that's a joke I mean it was maxed but wth was that … Game doesn't give you enough resources. I only tried to upgrade s rank weapons the weren't great weapons(1 attack) and after farming a lot of hours didn't have enough so I gave up.

I almost dislike every part of the game, the friendship conversations are soulless. A 4/10 is probably too high for this game"

It's unfortunate because it could've been a good game, but it stuck mostly to giving it a feeling of bringing people into the series which was already done by Three Houses and way better."

  ",5,"I'll get the low hanging fruit out of the way first. The characters and story are really boring. Not much to say other than the plot is uninspired and the characters are just walking tropes.
The gameplay itself is where I have mixed feelings. For every positive there is a negative holding it back.
For starters, bringing back the weapon triangle was a good move. The lack of it in the last few entries removed a basic level of depth many players **** emblem/ring system is an amazing addition that explodes the level of customization for your units to near absurd levels. Engage is maybe the best FE game when it comes to the ability to make sure your favorite units can clear the game.
Yet at the same time there isn't very much strategy to be found in this turn-based strategy game. Mainly due to the fact that every enemy on the map attacks with zero regard for planning or tactics, in favor of just swarming your army asap. Some maps suffer greatly from this while others lose any challenge they might have presented otherwise.
I won't hold the following criticism against the game too much, but with each new FE I hope they choose to make an effort to reduce RNG's influence on the gameplay. FE is always labeled a strategy game, yet ultimately what wins or loses battles are dice rolls. It is a problem that taking an optimal approach to any map can be rendered meaningless by RNG, just as making bad choices can be rewarded by lucky dice rolls. I will give the game credit for adding inheritable abilities that can help minimize RNG for the unit in question, but it is a small band-aid when a system wide solution is needed.

Ultimately, a game that has many excellent concepts and mechanics gets bogged down by too many flaws to deliver a very middle of the road experience."

  ",3,"The good:
-The gameplay before chapter 20 is the most polished, tense, and well-planned of any FE game I’ve played. Maddening mode is a perfect blend of fair challenge and punishing difficulty. The Engage mechanic is fun and adds a new level of depth to the experience. I do wish the mechanic could have been tied to something other than old characters, though. Ancient, mystical rings with allusions to old characters behind them would have sufficed, and the story might have been stronger for it.

-The changes made to the weapon triangle and how certain units function are well executed. Armored knights are now useful thanks to the new break mechanic, and overpowered weapons can’t steamroll through enemies regardless of weapon type.

-The combat animations are fluid and impressive. Critical hits are fun and feel like a return to the stylish critical hits from GBAFE.

The okay:
-The graphics, while more consistent and polished than the 2008-2022 entries to the series, are not to my taste. In addition, there’s a large amount of clipping on the models. Lumera’s hair will poke through the back of her cape, Clanne’s braid will swing through his chest/shoulder, any dangling cloth on characters like Timerra or Zephia will clip through their bodies when they move their arms etc.

-The voice over is good. Not quite on the same level as 3H or Echoes, but much stronger than Fates, Awakening, and the Tellius duology.

-The music is middling compared to other entries to the series. I can only remember one song after two playthroughs and even then I don’t particularly like that song much.

The bad:
-Engage’s story is, as many have pointed out, the weakest part of the game. The attempts at emotion were clumsily handled and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at some of the more “dramatic” scenes.

-The cast of characters is the least likable I’ve seen in an FE game. Even Archanea’s roster full of non characters with no personality was better than the roster of irritating characters in this game. Supports range from one note to mildly interesting, but any potential depth was left unexplored.

-The designs are overdone. The casual clothes are a great idea in theory. In practice, most of it looks too modern.

-The menus are cluttered and convoluted. The Somniel menu will not alert you if you have new supports ready to watch, and it hides them under a menu called “references”, which is not where I would expect to find them. They should have been their own tab, and the storehouse should have been moved under the inventory tab.

-QOL is bad in the shops, where bulk purchases are no longer an option. If you thought Anna’s “Is that the one?” “Thanks a bunch!” was annoying last game, be prepared for a whole new level of irritation.

-The Somniel is lacking. At launch there were very few activities to build supports between units, which can be crucial for combat in maddening mode. This has since been fixed with a patch, which I consider a negative because it should have been in the game at launch. Instead, they prioritized putting out day one paid DLC over basic functionality of the hub world. I didn’t enjoy any of the minigames, but still do them because the bond fragments they give are important if you want to learn new skills. -The multiplayer aspect isn’t fun and I gave up after trying both options. According to the version 1.2 patch notes, random match multiplayer didn’t even work at launch and had to be fixed. IS should have focused on making the base game actually function from the start instead of working on DLC.

-The cutscene audio mixing is poor and the music drowns out the dialogue. Marth and Alfred’s introductions are prime examples of this.

-Endless reinforcements aren’t fun or good gameplay design. Prepare to see a lot of them in the endgame chapters as well as the throwback chapters (even in ones that didn’t have it, looking at you, Celica map). This ruins what I considered nearly flawless gameplay, as it doesn’t allow you to prepare or recover from a missed attack in a meaningful way when you’re being boxed in by endless waves of enemies from all angles. At lower difficulties this may have been acceptable, but in maddening, where killing an enemy in a single round of combat is not an easy feat, it only keeps you locked in place for longer than you need to be.

-The hit rates are FE6 levels of shaky. Your units will consistently miss 80% and up hit rates, while enemy units will consistently hit at 30% or lower.

TL;DR: the game reaches some very high peaks and some very low valleys, making for a conflicting experience. As it stands, this is one of my least favorite FE games."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem Engage is an amazing game and the review bombing of this game is ridiculous. It is my favourite FE game alongside Three Houses, but I love Engage for all the different reasons.

The writing. This is what people are attacking in droves and honestly its nowhere near as bad as they say it is. First off, the story. Yeah if you compare this Engage's plot to Three Houses plot it is way worse but it's not really fair to compare the two. They had different priorities and the plot wasn't Engage's. In my opinion, Engage's plot is way better than anything Fates and Awakening had to offer. The same goes for characters. While Engage has a far less memorable cast compared to Three Houses, they are significantly better than the cast from Fates and Awakening. Honestly, that's all I could ask for.

Now to what this game excels at, the gameplay. Engage offers a unique gameplay style that no other Fire Emblem game does. The weapon triangle is back and actually serves a purpose for the entire game. Instead of giving hit points, it now comes with the break system which prevents the affected unit to counterattack for 1 turn. The Engage system is super fun, every different Emblem (that isn't DLC, I haven't tried those out yet) are each unique and powerful in their own right. My favourites being Lyn, Lucina and Byleth.

Up till now I've been praising this game, but now for some of the things that bothered me. First off, Engage's RNG is awful. In my opinion, worse than Thracia's. I raged a good couple of times due to the dumb stuff that the game did to me. So many 70s and 80%s missed by my units and the AI hits anything above 30% regularly. This was during my playthrough so I can't vouch for everyone, but all I have to say is prepare yourself mentally for the terrible RNG. Second the bright and colourful setting of the game. Fire Emblem is a game depicting medieval fantasy warfare and how terrible it is. People complained about Three Houses' gray and washed out setting, but Engage took it way too far with the bright colours and soft tone of the writing.

In conclusion, Fire Emblem Engage is a fantastic game and a must play for both veterans of the series and newcomers. The plot is nowhere near as impressive as Three Houses' but it's nothing horrendous (it is really cheesy though)."

However, the story was incredibly stupid, and return trips to the Sominel were always tedious, it truly could have just been a menu on the world map and I would have been so much more satisfied. Another reason that I am lowering it, is due to the inability to change the difficulty to higher settings. I feel bad for anyone who started on normal, got invested, then was stuck at it. It was simply too easy of a difficulty, so much so that it should have been called easy mode."

However, this game has a few shortcomings, mostly it's story and characters. The story is generic at best and really, really bad at its worst points(ch 20-22), the characters that the story focuses the most are kind of uninteresting, with the rest of the roster being a lot cooler. Also, some of the character designs are really, really weird, not fitting at all in a medieval fantasy setting. I much prefer the simpler design of some characters over the really exagerated ones.
The soundtrack is also good, but it's great how it dinamically shifts between a more action focused version of the song it's playing when you go into combat.
The UI of the game is also somewhat bad and clunky, you will spend a lot of time in menus when you are not in battle.
In the end this is a very worthwhile game if you are a fan of the franchise, but bad story and characters really do hurt the overall enjoyment of and RPG, for obvious reasons."

Apparently, this game is meant to celebrate the Fire Emblem franchise, and it succeeds gameplay wise, but in other things it was very disappointed. The gameplay and everything related to gameplay in this game is the only reason why I'm giving it a 7. It's so damn good. It's the best the series has ever been. But as a AAA game meant to celebrate a 25 yo franchise with a great story and beloved characters, it doesn't have a great story nor beloved characters. Even the characterization, graphics and moments of the heroes from past games it's so bad, giving importance basically only to Marth and characters like Ike, Sigurd and Roy looking so horrible with this game art style. I only hope that if they make a Genealogy or Tellius series remake they use more realistic art style. The story and characters of this game are so boring and cliche, reusing plots from previous game like Awakening and Fates. Outside of the story and characters the music is great, and it's good that we got a place where you can listen to it. The maps are really fun, i really enjoy the last 5 maps and the paralogues, even though i don't understand why my units can die in paralogues when it's basically a training section against the emblems. Even though I complain about the story, fire emblem has always been known for simple stories, but at least the characters were memorable, not the case in this game. I think I will only remember Diamant, Alcryst and Lapis tbh. The Villans were really, really bad in this game. The last thing I really hated about this game, was that, by the time of this review, there is no New Game+. This may be a small issue but still it hurted me a lot to finish the game and wasn't able to restart the game with support and skills already done like in 3H, something that I actually like because it made replayability more fun. Anyway, this game made a lot of bad decision, it doesn't make any sense that a game that follow one of the greatest games of the switch and of this generation of consoles, fells so underwhelmed and a step back in the franchise. They could' work in the bases of 3H and just improve the gameplay and maybe the graphics and we could have had the greatest game in the franchise, since without a doubt Engage has the best and more fun gameplay in the series, not even close. At the end of the day, in a couple of years we'll play a new FE with the same gameplay at this one but improving in the story, characters and art style, and it will be like this game never existed."

  ",8,"Después de completar el juego, lo primero que he de decir es que estoy en desacuerdo con muchos de los puntos negativos que se le han achacado a engage desde el principio, mientras que he de recalcar que, ¡existen otros puntos, que personalmente si que son negativos, a los que la mayoría de reviews no les han prestado la mínima atención!

En pocas palabras: fire emblem engage es una mezcla de decisiones de diseño, algunas excelentes, y otras horrendas. El resultado final sigue siendo un juego de notable alto, sobresaliente si los puntos negativos que explicare no te importan.

- Lo positivo: sin lugar a dudas, las batallas. Esto coincido con prácticamente todos. El diseño de los mapas en feg es de los mejores de la saga, y con las misiones opcionales deben rondar las 40 batallas. El juego se siente fresco en esto, introduciendo nuevas mecánicas en la saga, como los jefes con varias barras de vida o ciertos ""gimmicks"" que aparecerán por primera vez incluso hacia el final del juego, aportando variedad hasta el final. La fusion con los emblemas es la principal forma de personalización de los personajes del juego (el cambio de clases es más costoso que en three houses, así que es normalmente mejor ajustarte a la evolución normal de las clases iniciales) y se recupera el triangulo de armas. También se ha dado a los ""healers"" un arma: las artes marciales, lo cual añade un nuevo nivel de estrategia al ser efectivos contra magos, arqueros... y, aunque su daño es debil, la mecánica de desarmar a las unidades al golpearlas con una debilidad añade un nuevo nivel de estrategia a esto (al quedar desarmadas no contraatacan y puedes a continuación atacar tranquilamente a un mago con tu general por ejemplo).

Como otro aspecto positivo estaría... la historia. Y aqui evidentemente difiero con la mayoria. Sin considerar que la saga en general tiene las mejores historias salvo unas pocas entregas, la historia de feg sin ser de las mejores, debo decir que se encuentra por encima de la media. Existen muchos aspectos de la historia que realmente no arrancan hasta casi el final, pero una vez que todo concluye, te das cuenta de cuantas piezas bien puestas hay en ella. También presenta algunos de los mejores villanos, especialmente Griss y Zephia, cuyas acciones no son defendibles, pero si permiten empatizar con ellos cuando los entiendes (defenderlos en ningún caso eso sí). Sin embargo no hay que confundir la historia con otro aspecto que si hablare en el siguiente punto.

- Lo negativo: los personajes. Sí, no la ""historia"", lo que es bastante mediocre de este juego son los personajes en sí y sus relaciones entre sí. Existen personajes salvables y algunos realmente buenos, pero el plantel de personajes es enorme (uniéndose ademas de 3 en 3 normalmente), y muchos son cliches sobreexagerados (aunque algunos esconden detrás de esos cliches cosas mas profundas, pero no todos). Otro punto que puede ser clasificado aquí es quizás la narrativa, aunque esto es más discutible: este fire emblem tiene un toque mucho más ""naive"", inocente y también sobreexagerado en muchas de sus escenas, lo cual pienso que justamente lo hace una entrega fácil para entrar en la saga a generaciones más jóvenes, pero que no será para gusto de todos.

Y el principal problema con el juego: la economia esta rota y el somniel es un coñazo. El juego tiene multiples funciones online, y aparte de los modos puramente online, la principal forma de conseguir dinero es activar el online y recoger las ""almas"" de otros jugadores que perecieron en esa casilla durante las batallas (además de otros útiles). Esto, para aquellos que no tenemos online, significa que no hay forma de conseguir más dinero del que obtenemos puntualmente en la historia (no hay pepitas u otros items que podamos vender por mucho). Complete el juego en dificil con permadeath, y esto fue un infierno ya que no pude mejorar una sola arma hasta el final (ahorrando para poder mejorar 3 o 4 armas al final del juego), comprando solo bastones u objetos de promoción, llevando armas de hierro a batallas donde los enemigos ya me sacaban armas de plata como si fueran churros... esto esta francamente mal, y no me quiero imaginar intentar la máxima dificultad en estas condiciones...

El somniel que es el lobby del juego donde estan los minijuegos y demás... se hace pesado y repetitivo conforme va creciendo. Deberían diseñar minijuegos que cuesten de dominar y te entretengan durante horas, pero una vez completados te puedas olvidar de ellos, y no tener que repetirlos cada vez porque las migajas que consigues en ello son necesarias (en dificil) para estar al día. Esto aumentaba artificialmente la duración del juego a practicamente el doble, ya que hacia el final puedes tirarte una hora haciendo esto entre batalla y batalla"

  ",10,"Honestly, after reading user reviews of FE Engage, I was a bit sceptical about the quality of the game, but as a Fire Emblem fan, I've decided to give it a chance. And honestly, I don't regret that. I agree that story in FE Engage is not on the same level as in FE Three Houses (it is still quite pleasant), but the game cancels this inconvenience with - in my opinion - one of the best gameplay in the whole series. Thanks to removing weapon-breaking mechanics, the skirmishes are more dynamic, the maps are varied with plenty of unique mechanics, and the weapon triangle did come back after it disappeared from FE Three Houses. All of those elements perfectly complement each other.

Overall - in my honest opinion - if you like Fire Emblem Series for its tactical aspect, you will be rapturous. On the other hand, if the plot is the pivotal element to you, it (contrary to its predecessor) isn't a game with many possible routes, so after every subsequent playthrough, you'll see the same story again. Regardless of that, I would give this game a chance. The main plot should give you approximately 40 hours of solid tactical gameplay (more or less 60 hours with side quests).

The game is strong 9/10, but due to the review bombing I gave it 10."

  ",3,"Just goes to show that Koei should be making the Fire Emblem games, NOT Intelligent Systems.

Sure the voice acting is just as good, graphically speaking, it's technically better, and the game play feels good (although feeling too much like a super hero games half the time)

The **** opinion I have is this game is took as many steps backwards as it did forwards. For starters, I can't stand the character design. Everyone looks like children, even the adults. I prefer the mature themes, and while the protagonist is far better than Byleth character-wise, that's not much of a compliment as Byleth was just awful, meanwhile  Alear is just a typical teen.

Graphically the game is better, sure, but they don't do anything special either. At no point did I walk around to take in the scenery like I did in FE3H. Empty locations, with nothing in them.

Battlefield exploration is dull, and boring. Three Houses' battlefield zoom-in was infinitely better.

Somniel is basically everything I hated about Sanctuary in Three Houses:
1. Few characters in Three houses had boring things to say. Here EVERYONE has nothing interesting to say. It isn't even fully voiced.
2. Activities are a bigger chore than ever. Rather than being built  into the narrative (being a teacher, teaching your units, and bonding along the way), somiel is just there to take up your time.
3. More frequent loading screens

Character personalities are near non-existent btw. Everyone you recruit has NOTHING to add to the narrative outside their introduction maps. The Emblems are the worst offenders here. They get their own trashy support  called ""bond"" where they tell you that you have nice hair today, or something generic like that, but that's it.

Game play is the only thing this game did relatively well. The return of the weapon triangle feels really good. And while I think the super hero-style game play behind the emblems is out of place, the abilities are sick, and fun to use. Even if they are definitely OP.

All-in-all, Intelligent Systems tried to stick with the formula they know, while changing things for the worst in a lot of style, and narrative areas. And man, it's hard to go back to this older, but more childish style of game after the leap forward Three Houses Took."

  ",6,"The content of Engage is about paying respect to the whole series, which is wierd in first place, because they already did that in fire emblem warriors. Paying respect twice in one generation? What's so respectable about this franchise?

Fine, I am okay with it. However, while the characters are taken from decades back, the painting style is completely modern, it looks like a cheap mobile game! I'd played the Genealogy on SNES, in which Sigurd was illstrated with exquisite, handsome 80s darwing style, and now what Engage turn him into? A completely un-identifiable pedestrian. Same thing with Lindis from the Blazing Blade, and many other classic characters. Seriously, get your mind straight. Don't let Nostalgia become a cheap excuse for saving money.

I'm too loyal to Fire Emblem to give it something lower than 6, but I gotta be honest, the more loyal you are, the more disappointed you will be with this new instalment."

  ",0,"Pros: Squares and math

The only positive thing I can really say about this game is that it is a tactical RPG. There are squares to count, and there's math to do. I guess that's fun, but Fire Emblem Engage does very little to make it refreshing or interesting compared to other games in the genre, and it sacrifices a lot of elements from its previous entry, Three Houses.

Cons: Dull Setting, Uninteresting Characters, Recycled Plot, Awful Writing, Poor Quality of Life, Bizarre Character Designs, Lackluster Cosmetics, No New Game Plus

The writing in this game is crap.

The game is all about rings, so they made the continent a ring. It's divided into four quadrants, each one with the climate of a Mario level. Original. There are some meager attempts at establishing political relationships between the four countries, but it's pretty bad, and doesn't make the setting interesting. Fodlan was infinitely better.

The characters don't get even a fraction of the effort that the Three Houses cast received. There aren't even paired endings for any characters besides the one who the avatar S ranks. Character writing seems to have been a very low priority in this game and it shows.

The story is about the main character traveling across the continent to find all the magical items so they can defeat the big evil. It's a story you've seen a hundred times and Engage does nothing to put a twist on it or make it original at all. Some plot points are rushed through with no time for characters to process information. Other times, characters don't even get an ounce of their backstory revealed until they're on their death bed, as though players should suddenly care for this character. At its worst, I found the story outright insulting as it expected me to accept blatantly ridiculous developments with a straight face.

The game takes several steps back in terms of Quality of Life. Offenses include:
- Can't rotate the camera 360 degrees around the map anymore
- Can't remap buttons
- Can't hide the dialogue box
- The gallery of cutscenes, music, and Support conversations, is tied to specific save files instead of being on the main menu. This means you don't have a single gallery showing all Supports you've unlocked across multiple playthroughs.

I greatly dislike most of the character designs. The main character's design is the worst for obvious reasons. Others just have stars or hearts on their face. Is it a sticker? A tattoo? I'm not opposed to a little color in character designs, but many of them cross the line into pure silliness. I can't take them seriously at all.

The option to keep a character's default outfit in battle is gone. If you reclass them, they WILL use that class's outfit in battle with no exceptions. Cosmetic options in the Somniel (the base outside of combat) are unimpressive as well, often offering plain outfits with little to no patterning and color schemes which don't change between different characters. Oh, and these outfits cost valuable metals that you could be using to upgrade your weapons, so you must play inefficiently to use the cosmetics. Maybe they stay unlocked on New Game Plus? Except...

There's no New Game Plus. This is inexcusable. Again, several steps backwards on something they already had in their previous entry. With the costs of cosmetics, weapon upgrades, and acquiring new skills so high, the game seems to be built around the idea that you could use NG+ to reach things you couldn't in a single playthrough. Yet, they dropped the ball.

Mixed: Mechanics, RPG Stuff

Engage's main brag is new mechanics, such as using the Emblem rings containing old characters, inflicting the Break status, and new aspects of classes. As much as some people are praising these mechanics, I felt that they had a lighter impact than I expected on the gameplay. I definitely wasn't willing to sacrifice all quality in the writing for a couple of mechanical trinkets.

I felt that the variety in classes was lacking. In terms of magic, the Sage and High Priest classes are mostly clones of each other, leaving only two different magic classes: Sage and Mage Knight. Some classes, like Swordmaster and Royal Knight, are simply obsolete compared to others.

In terms of customizing units, I would have liked more. Units only get two skill slots to use, and the SP costs of acquiring these skills are extremely high. So much so that some characters will wait most of the game before getting a skill you want for them. There wasn't a ton of variety in these skills either, with some skills standing out as the most obvious choice for nearly every unit.

Overall, this entry completely lost my interest in the series. I won't pay much attention to future FE games unless they show a huge focus on writing, QoL, and greater customization of units in order to win me back."

Playing the game was a frustrating experience. Each character felt like a soulless tool, and they lacked memorable personalities, making it challenging to recall their names and images.

The story was a significant disappointment, failing to meet my expectations. While some might argue that the combat system in the Fire Emblem series is all that matters, I believe that a good game requires a reasonable story, character design, scene design, and music to support it. Investing all resources into one aspect does not make it a good game.

Overall, Engage fell short of my expectations. While the combat system is enjoyable, the lack of memorable characters and plot hindered my enjoyment of the game."

  ",4,"I'll start by saying, I am a big Fire Emblem fan, my first game in the series being Radiant Dawn. However this game left me being extremely disappointed.

First the story, uses literal every trope in the series shoehorning them in every second. Making it feel more like that events that happen in the story feel forced. As for this round of characters, I couldn't find a single one I enjoyed, and found myself skipping nearly every Support Conversation. It also doesn't help this batch of characters looks are often overly designed. The new batch of Characters will likely not mash well with others in Heroes either as this game is first to drop Nordic Names in favor of French names.

Then for the gameplay... Its painfully dull. The new Break System doesn't feel rewarding and often makes it more difficult to level up certain units. The ways skills work, and the finite amount of resources at your disposal makes the new skill system frustrating. Lastly what the games does and doesn't teach up in tutorials make no sense. Like the game will tell you about to shop, pet your pets and few mini games but won't tell you how skills are learned or bond rings work.


The only positive is seeing some of the older characters again. Kinda wish instead we got a game of Lucina traveling through time seeking help from different characters of past games instead of this weird mess."

  ",0,"Kind of a mess! Really just a game for anyone who still goes ""Squee"" and gets wet when they see Marth. I guess there's something to being such a FE fan that you get the reference when Sigurd gives you silly move and teleports across the battlefield, but it gets old.

I've seen a lot of people describe this as solid gameplay, bad story. I think the gameplay is pretty spotty though. Map difficulty is a bit like conquest, not terrible but oddly balanced. The expectation that you will use the rings maximally is baked in, a lot of houses you have to sprint to, etc. Weapon durability is out again, which they do every so often before realizing it breaks the economy and walking it back in the next game. They have this new donation system where you can get some minor map benefits, but it's not really a solution.

The biggest issue with the gameplay is the break system I'd argue. Getting hit by an opposing weapon locks counters for a turn. This, together with the decreased move, really just slows the game down. Armor knights become quite critical, with the most effective strategy being the ""ball of units"" one.

The story is quite bad. It's trying to be a callback to FE1 where Marth had to kill an evil dragon, but it somehow has less plot. Massive step back from Three Houses, one of the best FE stories, and I think a misunderstanding of what the fanbase wants out of these."

Positives: the upgraded engine looks good, though a bit faded when I was expecting the color to pop a little  more.   Maps are a little more interesting than 3 Houses.   Maybe a touch to many loading screens for my liking.
Negatives:   Gameplay is extremely breakable, in fact the game breaks itself early on by giving your main unit an extraordinarily amount of evasion very early in the game.   The new combat wrinkles dont really work that well, except maybe smash weapons.  Hard mode isnt even hard (though your view may differ as I am fairly adept at this style of game).
Story wise, its easily the worst written story Ive come across in any game in a while and the characters are completely one dimensional and flat.   They have 0 personality with maybe one or two exceptions.   If you enjoyed the social/bond aspects of other games, your going to be disappointed in this one (or at least I was).

Im not even sure who this game is for?   It has a lot of nostalgia factors by introducing old heroes as essentially ghosts who fight along side you, but the game itself seems like its trying to approach a different audience than the series has built up over every entry released in the West by devesting itself from the bond/social system.   Ive never cared so little about the characters, which is really bad because it kills any tension if say one character you really like gets in trouble.  In old games this would add a nice bit of tension.   Here I just kinda say ""oh whatever"".

I cant recommend anyone really playing this game since I cant even tell who this is geared for.   I guess if you can ignore everything except the gameplay you may enjoy it.   But even for fans, Id recommend just starting up an older game for more enjoyment.   Its not completely bad, but there are other games you can spend your money on."

I highly recommend this game! I've been playing it almost daily for almost a month now and I am thoroughly impressed. Although the story and relationships may not be as strong as Three Houses, the battle mechanism is top-notch and the game's fluidness is unbeatable. The ring mechanism and various abilities that are unlocked throughout the game are both inventive and fun, adding an extra layer of replayability. Despite the missed opportunities in the story, the game's design is impressive and the battles are particularly outstanding. I encourage you to approach the game with an open mind and focus on the battles, as you'll be rewarded with an enjoyable experience. Personally, I am still exploring the ring mechanism and skills, which has added a lot of fun to my gameplay. I am hopeful that expansion packs will provide even more enjoyment in the future!

1st Review (20 hours gameplay) Score: 7
Fire Emblem: Engage is a solid strategy game that offers enjoyable battle mechanics, thanks to the addition of Emblem rings and Break mechanics. However, the game falls short in other areas, particularly in the story and character design. While I haven't completed the game yet and have only played around 20 hours, at this point, I can say that the overall experience is lacking in depth and fails to live up to the standard set by previous entries in the series. In my opinion, the game is worth playing for the battles alone, but don't expect much in terms of a compelling story or engaging characters. Overall, Fire Emblem: Engage is a decent way to pass the time, but I hope that Nintendo puts more effort into storytelling and character design in future games."

  ",9,"FE Engage is a really good game. It's a shame to see so many low scores due to the lack **** storyline or romance paths. I loved Three Houses for many reasons but gameplay-wise this is more enjoyable. Maps are variegated and  enemy placement is improved. Emblem fusion is a really cool mechanic that makes team building fun and satisfying. Characters design may seem too over the top compared to 3H, but some of them are quite interesting and surprisingly well written. I played on Maddening difficulty and it was much more challenging (as it should be) than its predecessor. After 100 hours and beating the game, I have only two complaints:

-The main hub has better activities than  the previous iterations, but they become almost useless towards the second half of the campaign. There's also no reason to stick around since there's no romance (but you can still improve your bonds by providing gifts to your units)

-There is no NG+, which is a shame, but I can understand that since there are no narrative paths.

The online features are a nice addition, but I haven't spent much time with those. Tower of Trials it's very grindy, I guess it can be useful to improve your weapons before entering the Relay modes.

In conclusion, I would recommend this game to everyone who likes Fire Emblem, even if your first game was FE Three Houses, but… if you are mainly looking for a solid story, deep characters or just the romance, there are chances that you will not like Engage at all."

I will 100% not be listening to the fandom again.

Every fire emblem game they crap on everything wrong with the game instead of celebrating any part of it. This game has fantastic combat, beautiful graphics, and the pacing was spot on. I have played it twice now - once on normal and once on hard, going for maddening now - and am still enjoying it.
Is the story shallow? Yes. But so is every fire emblem game. Including three houses to a point. The hub of three houses was also absolutely atrocious, the maps were bad, and multiple playthroughs felt like a chore. *Every* game has its flaws, but that doesn't mean you should rate a legitimately good game a 1.

Churning them out one year after the next, with no real concern or attention to detail. The stories will be the same incipit, dull and vapid monotony. The characters lifeless and unrelatable. The combat? It's Fire Emblem mechanics. What you'd expect. The story and motivations are uninspired and fail miserably to capture interest or investment. For me, games like Fire Emblem have a unique tale behind the combat. Due to FE being a widely popular bankable property in the modern era, they now expect that you will pay them for brand notoriety alone. Barebones and without merit enough to justify it's existence in any fans library. Sad to see this series go the way of all properties that catch on in the west."

Instead of doing different stories we get to know about twelve different emblems from the vast story of Fire Emblem. It's amazing.
Seriously people who complain.... Don't judge this game on what you wanted to be a game but for what it offers. FE isn't a sim simulation nor a relationship simulator.

  ",9,"I think Engage is a great game. I started the series with Three Houses but, in the interim, went back to play some older entries - namely the 3DS titles, POR, and FE7. I think that left me with a different set of expectations than those who came to this game after only playing Three Houses.

Social sim aspects definitely take a backseat to the gameplay here - and its the best Fire Emblem gameplay I've experienced. The return of the weapons triangle and the addition of the ""break"" feature means that weapon selection and choice in character deployment is more important than ever. Compared to 3H, where I could just use the same characters pretty much every battle, I definitely find myself tweaking my roster and experimenting more here.

Playing on hard/classic, Emblems are powerful but definitely don't break the game. Their abilities are very strong but, since they are limited to once per engage and the meter can take a bit to recharge without standing on a specific area, they don't feel overpowered and instead add a unique tactical element to the game. Finding the right time to engage can make or break a battle, and I found myself waiting for the right moment instead of using them at random since I didn't want to be caught off-guard by a tough foe.

The story is generic, but that's fine for me. Lots of the Fire Emblem games revolve around there being a big bad and you needing to gather strength to face them, and this does that well enough. The campy tone is a nice change of pace compared to 3H, even if the story is comparatively lacking in depth and emotional punch. I still enjoyed the continent-trotting narrative here quite a bit.

I don't quite understand the criticism I've seen of some with respect to the characters. I get that the design is a bit divisive (though I personally enjoy them well enough and love the use of vibrant colors) but the writing is still pretty solid. Fire Emblem has always taken the approach of characters with one defining trait that have some more depth as you get into their supports - it helps a lot when the player has to differentiate 30 or so. I think the characters work well in that regard, and I found a lot whose supports I enjoyed just as many in 3H.

Presentation on the whole is great - the art style adopted here definitely works better within the hardware limitations of the Switch. Environments are much cleaner, there are less jagged lines, and animation quality has taken a big step up. Walking around the battlefields after one is over is also very novel, even if they are a bit lacking in things to do, and really showcases how nice the game looks.

This takes me to my main criticism of the game - the Somniel. While I appreciate it trying to be a more streamlined Garreg Mach, it only partially succeeds. After every battle, for the most optimal playthrough, you still have to walk/fast travel around the place to pick up a bunch of items, choose a meal, pick support partners for activities, do some fishing, and gain some experience in the arena. That's fine at first, but quickly gets dull. I wish there was a button to automate at least some of this by the mid-game, like automatically picking up all items or running support activities on previously selected characters. Sommie is adorable, though, so that helps.

All in all, I love this game. It's **** me in just as much as Three Houses, but for different reasons. I care less about the story, but I am ore excited to jump into battles than ever - even if they are just skirmishes on repeated maps. I hope that future entries can step up the story a bit and streamline the hub world, or adopt more of series like Persona to make that aspect of the game more consistently engaging, but this game's focus on gameplay pays off in a big way. If you are a fan of tactical RPGs, this is definitely a can't miss in my book."

There's no one in this story worth rooting for, nothing worth getting invested in, and the story itself feels like a crappy seasonal anime that no one would actually pay attention to if it didn't have ""Fire Emblem"" in the name... it's just painfully boring to try and play through.

I wouldn't recommend it on sale, or at all for that matter."

  ",6,"Here is my honest spoiler-free review for this game. I give it 6 out of 10.

Fine:
+ Graphics
+ Animations
+ Battles
+ Support conversations
+ Characters
+ Battle preparations, equipment

I put all 4 aspects above under the title of Fine; I mean that they're just good enough to be OK but nothing outstanding. Characters and support conversations range from decent to literally clown and cringe. If you do not like the weird design of some characters you always have the choice of picking the other characters. There appears to be enough different characters for everyone

Poor:
- Paid DLCs
- Nostalgia characters
- Infinite grind
- Locked on non-open gaming platform Switch
- Poor plot

I wish Nintendo just released Fire Emblem on PC so we could play in 4k 120 FPS. Some animations are too quick for 30 FPS so they wall apart.

The predecessor game Fire Emblem 3 Houses casts a big shadow onto Fire Emblem Engage and this is the curse of this game. Fire Emblem 3 Houses is superior in many ways and people (myself included) judge Engage because of it.

Overall I think this is an OKAY game, it gets well deserved 6/10 from me."

  ",2,"This game is definitely the next ""black sheep"" in the Fire Emblem series alongside Fates and Warriors. The story is hilariously bad (especially towards the end) and most of the characters are completely forgettable. I know people will argue that Fire Emblem ""was always anime"", but believe me and other older Fire Emblem fans (my first game was Path of Radiance on the Gamecube, current favorite is Echoes: Shadows of Valentia) when we say that this game ACTUALLY IS TOO ANIME. You can easily tell just from the art style and Vtuber aesthetics (if the story and voicelines weren't already big indicators). Completely far-flung from the more medieval fantasy-like world the series is more known for.

The gameplay is very unbalanced. Hit rates are completely broken as more and more people are noticing that they're consistently missing attacks that have 80-90%+ accuracy and getting hit by enemy attacks that have 30% accuracy. I don't know if it's a coding error or what, but the RNG is completely messed up in a lot of cases. The ring system is interesting in concept, but the more I played with it the more I came to realize that the game pretty much wants you to spam Engage attacks throughout the fights which sort of kills the immersion of trying to formulate intense strategies while in the midst of battle. They at least brought back the weapon triangle tho, which was something I thoroughly enjoyed.

Character growth rates are abysmal, and even worse most of the early units are easily replaceable with better units as you progress through the game. It's a HUGE step backwards from the level progression system of Three Houses and even the systems of older Fire Emblem games. You can somewhat mitigate these problems with giving your characters more skills via building bonds with rings, but it requires A LOT of grinding to give your characters the necessary skill points and bond points to get everything.

Most of the maps are uninteresting. The only ones that have interesting mechanics going on for them are in the last few chapters of the game.

The Somniel is a neat concept since it feels like an upgraded version of My Castle from Fire Emblem Fates, but even then towards the end I found myself feeling like it was there so that I could ""do my dailies"" after every fight like I'm playing some kind of mobile game (this game has a gacha mechanic as well).

There's a big spike in difficulty at around Chapter 11, and it's way more noticeable when playing on the harder difficulty settings. I did two playthroughs on both Normal and Hard respectively. Hard mode felt A LOT more stressful than Normal, and it's not even the most difficult setting. The people playing on Maddening are an entirely different breed. Godspeed.

Oh, and slight spoiler: You have the option to marry anyone in the roster, including two little kids and your little sister. The US version has been heavily localized to give the Pact Ring cutscenes different context, but overall you know what the original script was implying. Gross...

There's some fun to be had in this game, but the good moments are so few and far between that I have to give it a negative review. I genuinely love the Fire Emblem series, and it seemed like the series was only going to improve after Echoes and Three Houses, but obviously not every game can be a masterpiece. Here's hoping they address these issues in the next installment. I'm not worried about DLC. I'm done with this game.

Edit: I gave it a few points for good music and visuals. Like I said before some of the gameplay is fun, but it loses its novelty towards the end of the game on higher difficulties."

  ",3,"As a veteran of the series. I can tell you from first-hand experience that everything about this game fails in comparison to its predecessors. New players will be blissfully unaware of how bad the story, gameplay, music, and animation is through no fault of their own. What's worse is Engage constantly takes shots at veteran players who like characters such as Ike, Marth, or Roy over the cowardly, badly
voiced acted, and completely forgettable Alear. When a character like Diamant actually goes through an arc, fits the world he lives in, and is hands down the best character in the game. It makes me question why he wasn't the protagonist instead. Worst of all, the series is so predictable that when I guess something would happen later down the line, it did. That's probably because Engage rips plot points from other fire emblem games and the supports and conversations characters have with each other are embarrassing and cringy at its worst. It's that bad.

I'll just end it by saying this.
The era of the avatar is over, and what we need desperately right now is another Ike.

Edit: So I thought about it and realized my score was a little bit too harsh. So, I wanted to change it. It's still not a good game by a long shot, but I will admit some, but not all of the gameplay is fun. There are music tracks in this game that are composed really well, and characters like Diamont and Ivy were really the only things keeping me playing. Other then that, I still wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. Play Awakening first, or if you have a good way to do it. Fire Emblem Path of Radiance."

  ",3,"Diamant should have been the protagonist.

I can pick apart everything wrong with this game. The gameplay, the music, the animation, everything, but the biggest grievance I have with Engage comes from the avatar once again. This is the third game since Fire Emblem Fates where I had to sit down and ask myself ""why wasn't this character the protagonist?"" Before, it was Xander with Conquest. After that, it was Edelgard, Dimitri and Claude with Three Houses, and now it's Diamant with Engage. He is one of the very few characters that actually goes through an arc and character development. If you compare all the stuff he goes through to Alear's story. They have no where near the same level of writing and voice acting, not even close, and after feeling this way for the third time. The avatar character is starting to get under my skin and I believe they really need to go.

There are a good amount of characters in the Fire Emblem series since Fates that I feel deserve a second shot. Diamant is definitely one of them. He is the protagonist that I desperately wanted for so many years, and yes. A character like him deserves his own game, or a least a series of maps where the avatar is not involved."

And what you would expect from Fire emblem.  Maps had pretty good variety but it wasn't a great challenge (played on normal, classic).  The emblem mechanic was enjoyable and interesting. Gameplay isn't amazing but it's good.  Music is good graphics are fair.

The story very predictable and dull.  The things that the characters say they feel seems so fake and contrived because the game doesn't work to show the player why they feel anything. The characters aren't great.  They all are unbelievably smitten with the main character, its weird.  The voice acting is not good, particularly for a lot of the emblems.

I saw people say you can't compare engage to three houses if you haven't played other fire emblem **** I can. It's like telling me I can't say I prefer apples over oranges because I never tasted bananas..... that's just stupid. So let's start with the pros: - Beautiful graphics (I'm not talking about the artstyle here). It looks better than most switch games.
- Fun combat (not that different of 3H like people say but it's a plus for me, I love 3H).
- Good music (not on 3H level) but a few tracts were really good. Now the cons: - Horrible characters. 90% of the cast looks underaged, male characters are just effeminate losers, except like one or two. Main character is really bland and worshiped by everybody and it's not earned. Characters are way too colorful to fit in a medieval setting.
- Dialogue is super cringe, support conversations have no depth and don't develop the characters. They just talk about tea and things they are scared of etc. It's literally the conversations I was making my barbies have when I was 5. The supports were so boring I just started skipping them after a few. S support was also super dissapointing.
- Story is not great. It's cliche and linear and with no choices at all.
- Less classes with no visual preview of your character.
- Skirmishes give no gold.
- Somniel mini games are boring and useless.
- Latest heros, Dimitri, Claude and Edelgard are locked behind an expensive dlc. Emblem's outfits are locked behind amiibos. I would have to spend hundreds of dollars to unlock everything in this game. Three houses was a more mature game, with incredible dialogue and voice acting. With grief, loss, romance, and difficult choices to make. Fire emblem is a game about war, and engage felt more like a morning cartoon. I know some people didn't want to do the other routes in 3H because they didn't want to do the monastery stuff again, but you can literally skip it with new gameplus. I personally loved the social aspect in 3H, it was a nice change of pace in between battles. It made me really care about my students and I was really motivated to build them right and use them on the battlefield. I could also pick which characters I wanted to recruit. In engage, they just give you a ton of characters for free, and I just didn't care about any of them. I just felt like I was fighting with a bunch of clowns... Overall this is a stepback compared to 3H and I was dissapointed enough to write this review."

That what happens when you trash a perfectly great game just cause it tries something different and might not be exactly what you want. Engage was clearly tring to bring new people into the series and what do the origional fans do, cry offcourse.

As someone who has never had an interest in the Fire Emblem Games I was drawn to Engage by its buetiful colourful Anime aesthetic and amazing sexy and cool character design. I has played Three Houses for a bit and found it utterly boring. Three hour has hours of reading and  exposition it almost a visual novel. I was skeptical when getting Engage but luckily I was not disappointed, Engage lives up to the series high standard and I quickly fell in love with it tactics and world.
Why a tiny handfull of Emblem fans are negative towards Engage is a mystery to me, but with complacent whiney fans that review bomb a great game like Engage its no wonder the Fire Emblem series never hits the heights of being main stream. These complacent fans clearly enjoy the dull visual novel approach to these games over good pacing and a focus on tactics and getting to the action. But for be Engage is the direction I wish the series to go."

The new gameplay mechanics and difficulty on maddening (usually what I play) were a welcome addition.  This game is hard on Maddening, like vastly harder than Three Houses where you could break the game with a bit of understanding and effort.  So Difficulty and skill ceiling, definitely there. But Story, and game progression from Act to Act (if you can say there are) is very poor here.  Story is a shallow 3/10 at best and I often didn't feel like I was moving forward due to some new leveling and skill mechanics (only two tiers of classes and SP).  The Engage mechanic was fun to experiment with on a first run and swapping Emblems felt neat for a while, however I feel this game has very little replay value and that was something I was really looking forward to.  If you are a long time FE fan then I would recommend and am sure you will enjoy your time.  But with a bland paper thin story, lack of compelling game progression, and removal of loved mechanics(NG+, rotating the freaking camera on a map) this game doesn't quite reach the highs of Three Houses or older titles and will certainly disappoint some."

  ",5,"If I had to review FE: 3 Houses I'd give it a 10/10. I absolutely loved it and played it for over 500 hours. FE Engage was not mostly developed by TecmoKoei like 3 Houses was and is back in the hands of the creators, Intelligent Systems. What this means is that many of the things that really turned me off on FE Fates are back in perhaps an even bigger way. I'm going to break down this game by several categories for review. Let's start with the elephant in the room that many reviews are missing: the DLC.

DLC: You might be thinking ""why is DLC a topic for review""? Let me explain. While the game can be beaten without DLC, just like FE: Fates, it deeply impacts the experience. The entire game is designed around incentivizing you to by the DLC packs ($30 total). You're probably confused at this point, because most games have figured out how to do DLC without greatly affecting gameplay balance. Let me go over the systems affected, so you can understand:

Gold and metals are very scarce. You can farm them in side missions, but at a very slow rate. There are some cheese methods that slightly enhance your rate, but if you really want more gold and metals, you're going to spend many hours farming. These side maps are set 2-4 levels above your highest character and have over 50 enemies, so they aren't trivial either. Do you see how that might incentive someone to buy DLC when DLC packs give you weapons, permanent stat boost items, gold, and SP scrolls (a currency used to purchase skills)? Speaking of SP, I should mention how agonizingly slow it accumulates from killing enemies and how many skills are priced so expensive that I could not afford them by the time I beat the game. You will earn about 4-5k SP normally per character over the game, but I've seen skills cost as much as 8400 SP. There is no new game plus either and none coming later either. So seriously, you can see how their desire to have you purchase DLC permeates the whole game's design.

Then there is a spot in the game's story where they take away a large chunk of your power. Also, unlike 3 Houses, reinforcement spawns are infinite and provide low exp, but are just as powerful. If you have all the DLC packs the give you 7 powerful bracelets that are just as powerful, if not moreso, than this obstacle is a lot more trivial. Hardcore players will be fine, but this heavy handed approach hurts the game balance as a whole because they wants casual players to feel like they need an edge and buy the DLC.

I know it's bad form to spend half a review talking about the DLC and its impact on game design, but it's not talked about by major outlets and Intelligent Systems needs to be be called out for doing it wrong again. Fates had the same problems, but to a lesser degree. 3 Houses figured out how to do a fair DLC, but it probably didn't sell as well, so we're back to this model from Fates. With that out of the way, lets break the game down into its core bits:

Story:

Well, if you've seen anything, you've read that the story is bad and it is. Worst in the series bad. Some of the hammiest, cringiest dialog I've read from a 1st party, AAA game. It feels like they wrote the whole game for the mobile game audience (that spends way more than us normal FE players, btw). There's many times in the story things happen for no other reason than the writers will it to happen. It constantly breaks whatever immersion you have and the world does not feel believable or real. There is very little world building and what is there is lock into support conversations with your allies. Most of these support conversations revolve around 2 characters with 1 personality trait/hobby talking about that in the most boring way possible. The only thing that saves it from being a complete waste of times is the voice acting. They spared no expense and hired many top tier voice actors that you'll recognize if you watch any anime. They do a great job. It's a shame that Bernadetta voice actor from 3 Houses players the main female character, because she is given nothing to work with. The main character is the worst thing about the game. Everyone loves you and even those that don't usually end up loving you. There's no tension in the plot at all. It's closest to maybe the Pokemon kids show from the 90s. Be aware the player has no agency whatsoever over the story as well. Routes are gone, as well as dialog choices. It's the biggest letdown of the game, considering what 3 Houses gave us.

Gameplay:

I'm running out of characters, so I'm going to have to keep this more brief than I would like. Many people have praised the gameplay. It's mostly what you would expect from a FE game that gets rid of all the enhancements of 3 Houses. It's closest to FE Awakening, but we now have 12 rings and 7 DLC bracelets. All of which are varying degrees of extremely powerful. Which leads me to say that this is the easiest FE to date. I think they had real trouble balancing the game."

Now, don’t get me wrong I am not the kind of gamer who insists on an Oscar winning script in a game, if I want deep and meaningful I will read a book or watch a movie, but I would like at least some slightly convincing characters set in a slightly convincing story, but engage fails so utterly and miserably in this respect it’s very hard to recommend.

Score: 8/10

The game itself is an absolute gem of a tactical JRPG. The gameplay is tight and most of the battles are well tuned. With that said, the story is shallow and falls short when the opportunities to be great are given.

For my playthrough, I played the game on classic mode. This is the game setting that sets character deaths to permanent. The perma-death element surprised me by how much it added to not only the difficulty, but the richness of gameplay. Each move needed to be carefully considered. You can’t go all willy-nilly into battle or else characters will die and they will be gone for good. It made the battles  so much more satisfying to play and beat.

The developers did a good job allocating the Emblems throughout the game. Without going into too much detail to prevent spoilers. Due to the amount of Emblems in the game, they  could have easily all blended into each other. Instead you are methodically introduced to each Emblem and given time to use and understand the mechanics of each Emblem.

The menu system in the game is lacking. Incredibly un-intuitive. After 50+ hours in the game, I was still finding myself mis-selecting areas of the menu to check on basic tasks such as character equipment and inventor selection.

After every battle you can return to the homebase called the “Somniel” and handle a list of duties. These duties range from checking in on your farm, fishing, cooking and battling. None of it is overly taxing on the player, but it is time consuming. Adding anywhere from additional 10-20 minutes of gameplay after each battle.

The story is your very generic JRPG story setup with played out tropes. Thankfully, it largely took a backseat to the gameplay. What I came to think of the story, was that it more or less is the vessel to move the progress of the gameplay along rather than a core center point of the game that keeps you hooked. I do have to say the level of camp the writers managed to pack into the dialogue was so off the rails it was charming at times.

Although the story is shallow. The life-sim elements of the game is where I found the most meaningful character development. In the Somniel you can grow your Emblem bonds and character support. The support dialogue with your characters were generally entertaining and provided more insight into the character’s backgrounds and motivation than any cutscene did throughout the game. Unfortunately, this was not the same with the Emblem bond dialogues. Dialogues with the Emblems were dry and generic. A missed opportunity in my book.

After completing the story and all the paralogue missions I can say I enjoyed the core mechanics of the gameplay for my entire 55 hour playthrough, but was let down with the generic story."

The main character is incredibly unlikable. Nothing about him is consistent other than hes an effeminate **** and a huge loser. The most stupefying moment is his ""relationship"" with one of the antagonists. I was writing about how stupid it was but it was like 3 paragraphs to keep within the character limit and to keep the review spoiler free just trust me when i say its REAAALLLY STUPID.

Every other character is paper thing and one dimensional written completely around their designated trope. The support conversations (from the ones ive read and skimmed through because after a certain point i was fed up with this **** did nothing for character growth either and essentially just boiled down to:

""Hello Character i like *my trope*"" ""Ohoho character 2 *your trope* is quite funny here is *my trope*""

or

""Uh oh! Looks like *my character trope* and *your character trope* dont mix well, what kind of wacky antics will ensue!""

I was on a fire emblem thread on /v/ last week and saw someone refer to a character as ""Captain Estrogen"" and you know what. I literally could not tell who in the **** they were referring to in a game with an actual trans character because 90% of the male cast consists of some of the most effeminate losers in all of fiction.

The graphics are ""good"" in the sense that they have more polygons than the average switch game. But the artstyle is just atrocious it tries to go for this look with very vibrant colors but translates horribly in 3d coming off looking incredibly generic and uninspired like a ****ty Chinese 3d mobile game. On top of this, the character models are completely uninspired and look like they all were created in a character generator by clicking ""Randomize"" a few times.

Don't get me wrong, fire emblem has always had inspirations from anime behind its character designs, but in previous games it was very believable that the majority of characters could exist in a medieval fantasy world. None of the characters in engage, bar a VERY SELECT FEW, feel like they can fit into that type of world (the world the game is trying to portray). The thing is even if the graphics were incredible and made the switch look like a ps5, it wouldn't solve the root of the problem which is its awful artstyle. The design of the majority of character is just flat out garbage and dare I say, ugly. I sincerely hope Mika Pikazo sticks to drawing vtubers and never touches FE again.

Seeing how big the part of the characters is, ill keep the part about the story short. Its bad. Not in terms of plot holes and such it is a *somewhat* coherent story, but its some of the most lazy, half-assed, uninspired writing ive ever seen. It reads like a story someone in grade 6-7 would write for creative writing.

There are tons of awful scenes that try to be ""high impact"" such as deaths that try to pull at heartstrings but either end up making you laugh or want to skip through it as much as possible because none of it feels earned at all. You either never get enough time to grow attached to a character, or they try to make you feel sorry for the character the moment they die rather than building towards it.

The writing in general for both story and dialogue is cringe at its best and puts you to sleep at worst.

tl;dr:
I guess you might call it a “mixed bag.""

But let me tell you what kind of mixed bag. It’s a trash bag that’s had a bad day. Like, say, your mom cleans out the cat litter; fresh and stale doody pebbles go right in the bottom of the bag. And then your sister throws out her used tampons, and where do they go? In the same bag. And then your brother comes home, piss-ass drunk just upchucks, pukes right into the bag/ Now I’m not trying to be disgusting, but that is a realistic situation, and what it all comes down to, THAT'S A NASTY BAG. But I’d rather take that **** out to the garbage than deal with this piece of **** **** this game, get out of my face!

All kidding aside, its kind of like Conquest, but worse. Its worth a playthrough but its definitely not one ill ever touch again.

Score being as close to objective i can be: 6.5/10

Personal score: 3/10"

  ",9,"Fire Emblem Engage was a really fun experience for me. I honestly think the gameplay is some of the best we have seen from Fire Emblem. I would say the writing has some rough patches and I think the game being fully voiced actually makes those spots much worse. The voice actors did their job and it's more the tropey anime style direction that causes the issues many others are mentioning.

Despite the flaws in the story, I think the character cast is just as good as the last few entries of Fire Emblem games. I think the gameplay itself is outstanding and that's why I am rating this game highly. The Emblem Ring mechanic adds additional strategic depth and options that were extremely interesting and fun for me. I ended up with a core team at the end that I loved and felt comfortable with. But each map presented challenges and kept me on my toes.

Overall, if you are looking for challenging turn based combat that Fire Emblem is known for then I think this game is worth playing. Come in with low expectations for the story and I think you will find a great game. The high level of customization makes this game feel good and makes you feel like a tactical genius when you put together great/powerful combinations."

The main campaign offers very solid gameplay and each map is consistently fun to play. However, the game is hobbled by what is by far one of the worst plots in gaming history, the writing is poor the story massively cliched in a way that doesn't offer any enjoyment or pay off and by the late game the plot is such a train wreck it completely ruins the experience. 8/10 gameplay. 0/10 utter trash story that starts weak and just gets worse as the game goes on."

The gameplay is definitely a step up. I liked weapon triangle and how the characters moved. I liked the different maps for each NEW part of the story. However,  I didn't like revisiting the same maps again and again to farm resources.  The story is okay, nothing new or exciting just meh. It's a linear game with no meaningful choices. Lots and lots of plot holes and things that just don't make sense.

The outlandish character design wasn't that big of a deal for me.  What did bother me the most was the absent storytelling. The support/bond conversations really don't mean anything. Moments that should be sad weren't. The characters are either boring or annoying.  I really didn't care to learn anything more about them after getting the supports past a C.  Not that their supports told us anything much more about them anyway. I got everyone to A and it was a waste of time.

If you like a game that has great gameplay mechanics and a meh story is fine.  Then pick this game up. If you are like me and the story is very important to you too. Don't waste your money or wait till it goes on sale."

The visible improvement is only from the graphics, while for the gameplay it only adds the weapon triangle system which was already in the old game and the emblem ring system which is exclusive to this title. even though the emblem ring is innovative and unique, the basic gameplay only relies on that, if it is removed, then you can say there is no other innovative thing in the gameplay. And regarding the story and characters in this game, the story is boring and the character designs are too over the top and their dialogue is abysmal. There are even some mobile games whose stories and characters are better than this exclusive switch game, this is really embarrassing. overall I do not recommend buying this game at full price, because it is not worth your hard earned money"

  ",8,"Fire emblem engage is not a perfect game, but it is a great fire emblem game. While the game doesn't have the most nuanced story it has a decent one. Like I can confidently say that the first few chapters are some of the worst chapters I have seen in a fire emblem game. The story has some questionable dialogue especially when it comes to hortensia in chapter 15.   However, the last chapters genuinely come together to create this beautiful conclusion that long-time fans can appreciate, at least I did. I think even new fans can appreciate the game's story to some degree. Alear despite the very weird design they went with, is the most likable main character (maybe aside from robin) the series has had in a while. I also believe the gameplay can pick up the game when the story kinda lags behind. Even compared to three houses engage can hold up. There are bad characters in three houses and bad characters in engage. There are very bad story elements in three houses (especially the church route) and very bad elements in engage's story. What I am trying to get at is that comparisons between engage and three houses aren't quite fair. Just give the game a chance and you'll get something out of it.

I am not sure what people were expecting from the game, the trailers and announcements have focused on emblem rings being items you need to collect to stop the big bad guy. Sure it is generic but the things that happen during the journey can be interesting. While three houses was a success with divergent storytelling, fates were not. It has been a mixed-bag concept for the fire emblem. While engage can be boring at times three houses can be too. You need to repeat the first 9/10 chapters at least 4 times in three houses to get to the good stuff. This can be boring. Three houses, unfortunately, has set this expectation that fire emblem must have a bigger focus on supports, and divergent story routes, it really doesn't. I don't mind if a bad review is given because someone didn't like the story. Don't get me wrong I have been through three houses at least 5 times, i really enjoyed the new teaching mechanics and bonding with your students, but I also understood that three houses was another iteration of what a fire emblem can be. But to say the game is a 0/10 because it isn't building on what three houses was or isn't replicating it, I disagree with that. The last thing we need is for Fire emblem to become another persona game, let it stay fire emblem. A series that continues to try new things even if they don't work every now and then.

I am also not trying to invalidate the bad reviews I can see where they are coming from to some degree but some things are just superficial criticisms. Like the main character is held back by the weird hair. But does not make them bad main characters. Fire emblem has always mirrored anime character design. For example, look at awakening and how similar it is to anime released at its time. Localization is awful most of the time, but did you really want to romance anna (a child)? if anything I question the initial decision from intelligent systems (IS) to have anna as a romantic option in the beginning. Though changing up supports to be less romantic is quite annoying. Sure the story is extremely predictable but the execution in most significant parts of the story is quite good. Sure character supports have taken a back seat but that doesn't mean they are complete garbage. For the beginning cast sure the supports are pretty awful but as the more interesting characters begin to enter your army the supports improve.

Overall this is very subjective. but in my opinion fire emblem engage for long-time fans, is a 8/10. But for new fans, it is most likely a 7/10 or at worst a 6/10 because the story has some questionable moments and the game relies on nostalgia quite a bit. Nostalgia, that new fans will not have which is understandable."

I'd love to see more games with gameplay like Engage. The graphics are a huge step up from Three Houses, because that game was ugly as sin. The setting and story feels just like a GBA Fire Emblem, simple and straight to the point! And the characters can be pretty charming and silly at times. Lots of fun designs with various inspirations.

Being able to explore the battlefield after clearing a map is such a fun addition. I'd love to see that in more FE games.

I think it's a great game to help introduce new players to some of the legendary main characters from across the series as well.
It's like an All Stars-type celebration of the series.

The biggest change I adore is that you can get right into battles way more easily than the last game. It always felt like such a hassle how much busywork Three Houses had you do.

Maps were varied with dynamics that made each one unique and present interesting challenges. There were a few social sim aspects in three houses that I would have liked to see but overall, I feel like paring down those a little was the right call (less necessary social grinding as compared to three houses). What prevents me from giving it a higher score is that the story seemed cheesy to the extreme (and I generally dont mind cheesy). Didn't have high expectations but even compared to other fire emblem games (which weren't exactly bastions of narrative depth) it was really paint by the numbers.

If you're expecting a deeply political struggle this game is not for you. This game makes no pretense of being more than it is from the get-go with a Shonen style anime opening and easily identifiable character archetypes.

Music is good but I won't go as far as saying it is great. I find the UI pretty difficult to read and even the controls feel weird sometimes.
Character designs are arguably bad, annoying, and frequently would take me out of the story. I couldn't take a single character seriously either because their design was straight up stupid or their backstory was uninteresting/often non-existent. Some characters have literally no backstory and are completely one dimensional, only existing because of a specific trait that they will bring out in 80% of their conversation. I found myself skipping the support conversations for the first time in the series, it's hardly forgivable after the supports we had in Three Hopes recently.
The story events feel artificial, forced, and just impossible to take seriously. In general I feel like the tone of the game is too serious for what it has to offer, if there were effective jokes that could make me smile from time to time I would have certainly enjoyed it more.

I feel like there's a lot of toxicity in this fandom, but if you liked Sacred Stones, Echoes, 6&7, and just generally good gameplay with decent writing that's a lot of fun, you'll like this. It's more a fantasy story than a political intrigue, and it's well written. Please try it before you decide to just hate it. Or go play Fates again."

Characters are all pretty bland, and have pretty bad same face. MC worship gets annoying too.

Gameplay is pretty good - about what you expect from a fire emblem game, same with the music.

Also, maybe more of a minor gripe but I did not like the UI in this game compared to other Fire Emblem games.

I enjoyed it well enough but found it hard to be motivated to play more than a few maps at a time, definitely one of my least favorite Fire Emblem games that I've played"

  ",9,"The majority of negative reviews that I've seen, players are too upset at the rather generic story. The story and I wholeheartedly agree, is definitely not even close to being the best Fire Emblem has to offer. However, these individuals are far too polarized and fail to understand how to write a proper review. They list a few positive elements to add legitimacy to their review, yet blast the game with everything they can think of that they dislike about the game. They fail to look at the game holistically, including artt design, character design, environmental design, music, plot, combat, etc. This isn't to say that I'm a master of writing reviews either, but I will at the very least write this trying to encompass the game as a whole rather than use this as a platform to vent and rant about what I don't like.

Plot
If you're playing this game for the story, be warned that it is by no means a great one. The plot points are generic and predictable a lot of the time. It is to the point where I genuinely believe even my infant cousins could predict what's going to happen next. However, the characters have their moments and I genuinely believe that they tried with the story; if you play the game and don't like it, say something. I think it definitely could have been better but I was satisfied with it.
7/10

Music
Do not use the game's opening theme as a gauge for how good the music is; that opening song is hot garbage. Bar none, the worst thing I have ever heard in my life in Fire Emblem game. However, the rest of the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. They fit the environment extremely well and had me stop combat just to stop and listen. Here is a link to the soundtrack on youtube, go to the comments and click some of the timestamps (avoid the final boss theme for spoilers as that track is just magnificent). My personal favorite is the Desert Battle theme (Bright Sandstorm). The soundtrack, like all the other recent FE games, is just phenomenal and the remixed themes belong to the older characters (Emblems) are good too and should bring a decent amount of nostalgia if you're a series veteran (I'm not, my first game was Awakening and even still I loved getting to hear Awakening's soundtrack again)

Character Design
The main character looking like toothpaste pulled me at first. However, as I played it, I got used to them and even started slightly liking it. It was like looking at a master artist's attempt at drawing like a preschooler, a charming attempt at drawing something absurd. I understand why others would dislike a lot of the characters however, living in the medieval ages and running across someone with pink hair and star tattoos on their face would make you think some Vtubers are invading the dark ages. I was discontent with this at first but some of the characters, like Yunaka, grew on me. I don't LOVE how they look but learned to like them. However, some of the art conflicts with the times, as some characters have turbine wings when they Engage, which doesn't make sense as the most advanced thing in this time period is a goddamn windmill, so why? Very odd choices here and there that raise eyebrows, but overwhelmed by the number of fantastic choices when it comes to character design.
8/10

Art Design
This game is one of the best-looking games available for the switch. The game looks so beautiful and so amazing that I cannot believe this dinosaur of a system is actually able to run it. The environments are detailed to the point where if you get hit through a fence in battle when you return to explore the map, the fence will still be broken. The game's art is fantastic with vivid environments, and fantastic architecture, and with the Switch's successor coming out within the next 1-2 years, this may very well be one of the best-looking games next to the upcoming Legend of Zelda game. The game looks and runs well!
10/10
Character development
If you want Three Houses' level of development, do not play this game for it. You have to have dozens of support conversations just to learn the tiniest tidbit about characters and their emotions to the point where I was frustrated at how unnecessary this was. Awakening, Three Houses, and Fates revealed a decent amount about characters and what drives them through the cutscenes, events, and choices they make throughout the story. In this case, not many of the characters actually even APPEAR in the cutscenes. Only the Lords and your main character typically are involved in cutscenes and major story points, leaving your last hope of finding more about your favorite character to you spamming support, shoving gifts in their faces, and mixing and matching every single character's support combination till you finally learn some meaningful things. The characters though really won me over with their interactions at times and made it begrudgingly worth it

  ",10,"Essentially Fire Emblem Awakening: 2. If you loved the entry that revived the franchise then you'll love this one.

The introduction of emblems, as well as a less-advertised mechanic known as ""Inherited Skills"", and the ability to earn proficiency in any weapon simply through the use of 'Emblem Bonds' make this the most creative and flexible Fire Emblem game in the franchise. While instructing does not make a return, units can pretty easily access any class and will likely be pushing nearly a dozen skills between their personal, emblem, class, and inherited skills by the mid-game, all up to your choosing.

Where its story is comparatively more simple than its predecessor, especially in the first 5 chapters where it feels particularly weak, it makes up for it in its extremely versatile and addicting battle system, and Emblems and their bond skills feel 100 times more fleshed out and impactful than something like Three Houses's comparatively weak and 1-note 'adjutant', 'battalion', and 'combat arts' systems.

Phenomenal game with loveable characters, I could probably sink a thousand hours into this game and not get bored. While it has some weak story beats near the beginning, I would absolutely would recommend, especially for new-comers to the series."

  ",7,"Fire emblem engage brings interesting new mechanics and fun new ways to play the game, but falls far short in terms of storytelling and characterization which is especially disappointing after previous entries have demonstrated that they are capable of telling a strong story with interesting characters.

Gameplay: 8/10
Starting with the best part first, the gameplay of engage is a refreshing return to the roots of fire emblem after being what I believe was the weakest part of the previous entry, three houses. Engage introduces a lot of interesting new mechanics like breaking, smashing, and secondary classes that change the way the game can be played and allows for the player to form interesting strategies and approach each situation in many different and creative ways. The new emblem system, despite being disappointing from a narrative standpoint, also allows give players even more avenues to approach the game and experimenting with different pairings of units and emblems was wholeheartedly enjoyable. What's keeping Engage from getting a full 10/10 in this category from me is that I'm not a huge fan of the new primary class system locking units to only one weapon type in their base class, and although emblems can make up for that fact it was very confusing trying to figure out exactly how proficiency and the weapon system works. Additionally, gameplay balance is somewhat lopsided making some classes are miles better than other and some units completely overshadowed by others that are introduced just one chapter later.

Story: 4/10
To put it nicely, the story is uninspired. To put it a little less nicely, the story is a mess of poor writing, undeserved character moments, clichés, and dialogue that somehow manages to drag on for too long while providing no content. The overall story plays out almost exactly as you would expect it to from minute one; you can tell as soon as you meet them which characters will die and how it will advance the plot. On top of all that, instead of starting the story as an amnesiac tactician, a boy from Ram village, or other similarly mundane roles, you start of the game playing as the divine dragon, worshipped by everyone across the continent. This makes it so that most character interactions take a similar course and our character sees very little development throughout the game. After all, how much higher can you take a character who starts of the the literal god of the land?
Lastly, the worldbuilding was poorly done and the world itself feels very small, despite spanning an entire continent with four theoretically interesting countries. We spend very little time exploring the potentially interesting landscape, hopping from town to town or various locations of interest like in many previous titles. Instead we traverse through countries in one or two steps, going from castle to border to castle again, rushing to meet the next bland, predictable, story beat.

Characterization: 5/10
The characterization of this game was what I was most disappointed in, as Three Houses has shown us how good it could potentially be. Instead it feels like the characters in this game are flatter and more one dimensional than fates or even the GBA games. Most support conversations in this game are all very samey and do very little for actually fleshing out the characters, often consisting of nothing more than both characters tossing compliments back and forth.
The characters in this game lack a lot of the spice and quirkiness that made more memorable characters from other games so endearing, like Ingrid laying into Sylvain for his horniness, Seteth's overprotection of Flayn, or even Annette's singing. There are some characters that do toe the line of being interesting, but even in those cases they seem to always take the safe route and make them just another affable agreeable clone who tries their best to help everyone."

The story leaves something to be desired, but Fire Emblem has never been about the stories for me, so isn't too big of a deal."

They are both good, they each aren’t perfect, but they are great entries.  FE3H social sim aspect is my main complaint about that game, as it does take me out of the flow, and made it harder for me to want to keep moving through the chapters.  I took a long break from FE3H, only to finish up the last 8-10 chapters in Dec/Jan before FEE came out.  I couldn’t put down FEE, finished by the 2nd Saturday after release.  I think FEE is really going to be seen as that perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series and give them snapshots into the older games to entice them to want to play them. (Though a lot of those games are cost prohibitive at this point)

FEE was super enjoyable and the only other “step back” is that I would have liked the Somniel to be more important overall like Garrett Mach was, and I do think a couple of the moments in the plot needed some work, but overall I’d say FE3H and FEE are very much both great games, and neither is perfect, but because they do have some of differences and the majority of the people i see not liking FEE call out the Persona-like limitations being the thing they didn’t like.

Anyone review bombing the game cause of the lack of Persona elements, doesn't really like Fire Emblem."

  ",8,"EDIT at end after putting in 60 Hours, revised my review to 8/10 from 7/10

TLDR: If you're looking for a solid SRPG strategy game, this is a must-buy. Best gameplay out of any FE game I've played.
However if you don't care about strategy, but can't stand cheesy writing and poorly developed characters, this is a hard one to swallow.

-----

After putting in a good 30+ hours, I first want to congratulate whoever was handling the difficulty. It's miles better and more balanced than the previous entries, and so far I've enjoyed playing the gameplay for what it is.

Art style can be hit or miss, but I'm still amazed at how every playable character has unique designs to them. There are also a LOT more units than before, so props to the amazing artist.

The huge glaring issue for me is that the characters are too shallow. The story is simple, but then a lot of JRPGS are. For me, it’s more about the interactions between the interesting cast of characters that impact the story. This entry however doesn’t have that.

Part of the issue I believe is needing more screen time for the many different characters. Interactions between emblems and different characters are too short. Except for a few characters, they don't even get screen time in the main story. There aren’t any character unique missions, and this also makes the characters lack depth. I feel like they had something here, but either had not have enough time or just weren't competent enough. It's sad because the characters all had unique interesting designs.

As a result, classic didn't feel classic enough. When units died, I reverted time out of habit and because of completionism. Not because I had attachments to characters.

All in all, it's a solid game, but I really miss some of the story elements they left out.

EDIT: the story and character interaction with the main story are still pretty lackluster even towards the end, but I really have to give this game a higher score for the devs who did an amazing job on map design and ability balance for units, on both hard and maddening difficulties.
Reclassing and skill choice is more focused compared to 3H, but I feel like that actually helped out the devs with balancing the game."

  ",4,"Absolutely the worst Fire Emblem I've ever played.

Wow. Where do I even start? Awful writing. Terrible writing for a pretty unenthusiastic voice acting experience. No offense to the voice actors, you can only do so much with terrible writing. Every single one of the characters is a nothing personality. And the Emblems may as well be a Siri AI with even less personality. Now, sure, Fire Emblem has always been campy. But they tried! Here's some campy high fantasy dialogue you can just commit to. This lacks commitment to any kind of real threads woven through a story. Just a hodgepodge of ""I guess there should be some dialogue here..."". Normally I look forward to Support interactions and I just can't even stand listening to these people.

And to do that to our favorite heroes? Lyn is one of my favorite characters and she's just a nothing sandwich. I'd honestly prefer the Emblems be silent ghosts. It would ruin them less for me.

And the characters! Oh my goodness, what a bag of garbage. With like... two exceptions... every other level ""Here's three more nothing characters made up of a prince/princess and 2 retainers"". And that's it. Zero depth. I don't care about any of them beyond what they can do for me. Yunaka is maybe the only one that displays any kind of personality.

For Combat, I appreciate the weapons triangle. I don't much care for the Break system. Its a choice. Its... fine.

Now these rings... Did we really need Mega-Evolutions for our Fire Emblem Pokemon? It can be kinda fun, but its too much. Far far too much. Its a massive jump from ""Here's your legendary Axe"" to ""Here's..... all this stuff"". I'm not trying to memorize a million different things in order to find decent combinations. For a game as simple as this at its core, adding complexity for the sake of complexity is just stupid. We're spending more time on setup for battle than actual battle. I appreciate the utility the rings can provide. Its an interesting addition, but it just does not hit very well as an overall system.

And these Somniel activities... what a bunch of garbage. These mini game are silly and worthless. They're not even good. Wyvern riding is an absolute travesty. None of it is important or remotely worth the time to do any of it.

Bond rings? Really? Maybe cut the amount in half. Who's got time or resources for all this?

Also, I've never been poor in a Fire Emblem game before. I've got a castle and you're telling me we're broke? Meanwhile there's a whole philanthropic system to give all your money away just to adopt pets or fight battles to get resources for upgrades you..... now have no money to afford? Just wow. Just. Wow.

And where's the choices? Where the defining moment that allows me to choose a different path for multiple playthroughs? So far I've got no reason to play again after this abhorrent story resolves. So far my protagonist is just along for the ride.

And its been well documented how ridiculous the protagonists look. All justified. They're absurd.

It feels like they took Three Houses, which I enjoyed despite being a bit of a departure from earlier entries, and completely misread the generally positive feedback. Took all the garbage, cranked it up to 11, then left all the good stuff behind. The only thing they left in Three Houses that I'm happy about is the teacher-student love affairs.

I just don't understand how we got here. Maybe playing Triangle Strategy to fill the void Fire Emblem left set my expectations too high. I go from a difficult ""Hard Mode"" where I actually have to strategize to this cake-walk of a ""Hard Mode"" and I just can't help but be disappointed.

I think this really disillusions me to the franchise. I'm unlikely to preorder, much less purchase, the next game in the series. At best, if it reviews well, I may get it after its been out a while."

  ",3,"I'm an RPG fan who ran across the series since Awakening. To those ppl assuming negative ratings come from otome crybabies, Let me tell you something.

I don't care about the S+ support and romance. That's a side feature to garnish the ending afterall. I don't know where yall have been reading those comments from, but yall aren't getting the major problem. Most say the same thing: Story, story and story. Note that Fire Emblem is an RPG game, a game that requires enough plot and setting so that it motivates us to take action as our character. Well, Engage failed to meet the average player's satisfaction due to lack of quality with all those childish plot, unnatural lines, weeb action, etc. Those features don't even reach the modern Shonen standards.  No matter how much i tried enjoying the combat, the unbearable cutscenes and support lines kept ruining the fun.  I can skip them all, but that would basically mean this game failed as an RPG.

So yea. I don't need any otome bishoujo element, especially after watching all those scenes.
BUT
I would rather have that than the uncomfy 'petting' feature they added back. Now that's more otome, but it came out to be nasty. That ring polishing with all that kimochi this, kimochi that... was absurd."

  ",4,"For a review of the story, see the many other reviews. Considering gameplay: Messy balancing and tedious, undercooked gameplay parts ruin potential fun.

Many other games, even indie games, either have good balancing or clever options to adjust difficulty, not so Fire Emblem : Engage, regrettably.

""Normal"" and ""Hard"" difficulty quickly evolve into ""send arbitrary unit forward and let it 1-hit-KO any enemy"" snoozefests. To raise difficulty, you have to restart the game completely.

The highest difficulty, ""Maddening"", provides challenge but completely messes with the game's balance and gameplay systems:
- Your units gain experience slower. In effect, the characters you start with trail behind pretty quickly while progressing through the story. Every single new character that regularly joins your party is stronger right out of the box. Thus, you're pushed to constantly replace older characters with new characters, eliminating choice and any attachment you had to these characters.
- The base game offers no relevant options to let older characters catch up (disregarding inconvenient and overcomplicated cheesing strategies)
- But wait, there's a DLC that comes with a skill that let's your characters gain 20% more experience! The drawback: I had to completely restart the game again to profit from this skill's effect.
- So I restarted the game again with the DLC and let my units gain 20% more experience. Difficulty again: Maddening. And yes, this time my older units stayed relevant. Regrettably, by chapter 10-11, supposedly difficult missions, my party was again completely dominating, smashing enemies the story wanted me to escape from, eliminating any challenge and immersion again...
- So yes, I could think about what limitations I could set for myself to have a balanced game, and restart the game a third time... but honestly, I find daily chores to be more fun than this.
- In summary, this game seems more like a very fiddly sandbox you need to extend (buy DLC) and tune very carefully to not ruin any fun. Even then, the toolbox feels way too clunky.

- Most of the combat is limited to simple unit movement with simple ""rock-paper-scissor"" tactics. Varied tactics like ""Gambits"" in ""Fire Emblem: Three Houses"" have been dumbed down and only play a minor role later in the game.

Interface problems, contributing to a lot of fiddling and confusion:
- For example, if you want to change a characters' skills you need to access its inventory first... Yet, you can't equip a ring via the inventory. For that, you must access a different interface via the main menu...
- Yet again, not all options to interact with rings can be found in this one menu. For some options, you must visit the ""Ring Chamber"", adding more loading times.
- In the ""Ring Chamber"", you can inherit skills from a ring. Yet sometimes, you need more training with that ring. For that, you must visit the ""Arena"", adding more loading times.
- To get to the next mission you have to leave the hub and load the world map (more loading times). From the world map, you can access the next mission (more loading times).

Undercooked yet relevant hub activities which get tedious way faster than the hub activities of ""Fire Emblem: Three Houses"":
- While in the hub (the ""Somniel""), you can interact with the game's mascot to get bonus materials. You can feed it (loading times) or pet it (loading times). To access either menu, you leave the previous pet or feeding menu (more loading times) while you wait for long, unskippable animations to finish...
- There's a couple of tedious and undercooked mini games you can play in the hub to get relevant materials after each mission. These mini games (like pressing ""A"" to do push ups) overstay their welcome the first time you're playing them. But to get materials the games nudges you into wasting your time again and again with these mini games, since it takes a good amount of time doing each of them.
- The interaction with characters, especially the Emblem heroes, can be likened to talking with theme park mascots."

I saw some people saying support interactions are bad but I didn't notice something really bad, tho I can see some characters being annoying for some people. I find it good to have a lot of different personalities and some support convos actually offer a new insight about the character. Main aspect of the game is the gameplay and it's really good. Emblem mechanic is just amazing and it's so hype to see so many faces from the past games. All of them offers different gameplay mechanics and my maddening-classic experience in the second half of the game has been so good. From this comment section, I saw a lot of people being too harsh on the game, the quality of the game and the details are both extremely solid. I don't want to give spoilers so I won't mention some interesting gameplay interactions but if you're not enjoying the gameplay much despite liking the past titles, just keep going and you will love it as it gets better and better.

I as an old FE fan, have to put this as the worst game released from Intelligent System. Terrible story, useless side features, and censored lines. Just nope.

I would give 4 bc of gameplay, but decided to rate '0' so they can learn that Kitajima is ruining their game. Just like he did for FE Fates.

10/10 Art. This is why I was interested in the first place, I'm a fan of the artist for their FGO and Vtuber work.

6/10 Story. Very generic but it sounds like most of the FE games are story wise.

Some reviews are complaining about the characters, play the game with Japanese voice acting, English voice actors for games like this always ****. The characters are fine, it's ironic some of these reviews are calling them bland when the entire old fire emblem cast is just generic blue haired guy with sword. This cast has some hits and misses, but I've seen the characters in past games and these people are full of it if they think all the generic trash from before is any better. Zappy!

Don't listen to the bad reviews.

Indeed the characters range from mediocre to awful, and the plot is uniformly poor. I also hate the character design in this one - the blue and red motif inparticular annoys me at a fundamental level.

Fire Emblem still hasn't reached the heights it achieved with Awakening. Engage isn't 'bad'; it's just not great, and when you've played past entries and know just how great the series can be, that makes it a difficult one to review with any objectivity. If you're a series newcomer, maybe you'll give this a bit more leeway than I am, but I honestly can't see anyone being blown away by this regardless of your past with the series.

My advice would be to go and pick up Fire Emblem: Awakening if you want to see the series at its' best in the modern era.

  ",10,"Fire Emblem Engage is probably one of the best Fire Emblem games to date, for many reasons. Beautiful graphics, great combat system that even OG players will enjoy. Overall it's a fire emblem game that will please the majority of fans. But that's not to say the game doesn't have it's faults, of course. Fire emblem Engage is not perfect, yes It's a vast improvement from the last installment, but It still has it's problems of it's own, I will list some without spoilers.

The story is not great.

For long time fire emblem fans, one Thing that many of us can agree on is that the stories in most of the fire emblem games are not great. Awakening is very forgettable and over all not very well written. The Fate games lore is just not very good, and just just two of the many. But of course there are exceptions like Genealogy of the holy war, Three Houses, Echoes, and of course Radiant Dawn, games that have very rich and intriguing stories that will draw the player in. Overall I think a good story is essential in a game. It's what draw the player to play more, dig deeper into the game. So without a well written plot, what's the point of even playing the game?
But again I'm not say the story is bad, I'm fact far from it. I just think it has too many cliches and generic trops in it. But over all I don't many people will have a problem with it.

Now let's talk about the good things about the game because there is a bunch.


1. Beautiful cutscenes, graphics and Character animation.
2. Great cast of unique well designed characters.

3. Amazing voics acting.

4. The best the combat system has been in FE

5. Many fun and cool side activities to do besides the main story.

6. Supports with characters.

Overall I've had an amazing time with Fire Emblem Engage, and I plan on playing it many other times. For fire emblem Engage I give it a 10/10. Some people may thinks it's way to high, and it may be my own personal bias because I'm a huge FE fan. But I did genuinely have a great time playing and I think if you want to get into the franchise then this will be the best point to start."

The Unity engine should only be used for indie and free-to-play games. Not even EA is that greedy to sell me a Unity game for $60. As a matter of fact, I don't remember the last time I spent $60 on a game made with Unity. It just goes to show how extremely cheap and lazy Nintendo are. Imagine charging $60 for an indie quality game. The graphics are a joke. It literally looks like a mobile game. The physics are beyond horrible. When I pay $60, I expect top notch AAA quality. That is exactly what this game lacks. The combat is boring and repetitive. The story is garbage and the dialogue is cringeworthy.

There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. Remember when Nintendo used to brag about quality, to the point where they slapped a seal of quality on the cover of their games? They created that as a response for Atari's massive collection of shovelware, and now they have ironically become what they mocked. Nintendo is a multi-billion dollar company. There is no excuse for these cheapskates to sell shovelware made with Unity for $60. That's pathetic. I don't recommend this game at all, unless you want to support laziness.

Edit: Turns out there is a so-called multiplayer. Why didn't they put it in the main freaking menu? Jesus Christ are these developers so irrational. The co-op is a joke.

Pros
Great Gameplay back to the more strategic style of Fire Emblem + fresh new ideas!
Improved Graphics definitly the best looking Fire Emblem so far x good stable 30fps
-Great Music as always ranges to soothing themes to rock but + some returning ost
-Great way of telling the story with cgi cutscenes gone are the horrid 2d/3d hybrid cutscenes
-Has online feature Tower of Trials

Cons
Strange story pacing sometimes too fast sometimes to slow
Weird dialogs because off strange localization choices

Gameplay
In my opinion  Fire Emblem Engage is a fine return to its roots with more focus on the strategic elements which are visible trough the return of the weapon triangle, better map designs and new elements like Emblem rings and Break mechanics which takes things in a fresh direction.
But it also took some notes from Three Houses with its hub base Somniel wheres you can talk with
allies, collect items, buy/sell items & weapons, eat in caferteria, battle in the arena, tower of trial and more.

Technical aspect
By far the best looking FIre Emblem to date with improved graphic, colorful designs, well modeled character models (even if you don't like the design they still did an awesome job of modeling them), stable 30fps, faster loadtimes.

Story
The story this time is more akin to Awakening or Shadow Dragon and has one straight path instead of 2-3. The story is told in great cgi cutscenes and ingame cutscenes gone are the days of the horrible semi 2d /3d cgi cutscenes and the small frames pictures. The story felt more lighthearted and more like a saturday morning anime instead of a romance of three kingdoms story that the previous installment had. So in my opinions it's not bad just a different approach and depending on what you like more could be a good ir bad thing. The only bad thing is the strange pacing of the story and the weird choices of dialog in the localization.

So if you are realy looking for a similar game like three houses with the exact style of gameplay and story you may get dissapointed but if you're looking for more superb and strategic approuch of gameplay and don't mind the new elements and design choices you will definitly have fun with this game!

So decide for yourself its your life, your money buy it if you like the premise of the game anybody has right to have their opinion and should not be swayed by the internet."

The game's story is horrible, it has an online mode that doesn't quite work, and you have to do a lot of mini-games and repetitive farming between missions (not mandatory, but it provides too much improvement to pass up, especially if you play on high difficulty).

Fire Emblem engage seems to me a game totally based on combat, very large scenarios, full of enemies with nice animations. The amount of emblems and characters that there are allow a huge (even overwhelming) customization and depth. It forces you to measure very well not only your movements on the battlefield, but also how to manage your resources, who to equip the emblems to, what class they should have, what equipment to buy or improve...

In short, in this Fire Emblem they have completely left aside all the story and character interactions, but if you are looking for a real spectacular tactical challenge, Fire Emblem seems to me superior to Three Houses, although the latter is undoubtedly a much more rounded game.

This is coming from an old school fire emblem fan who loves Fire Emblem like Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War and an some of the newer stuff like Awakening. To put it simply this game was able to invoke emotions that I have not felt from a game in awhile it really made me feel good to see Marth, Sigurd, Roy and the others, and the new cast is also very well done and the voice actors for alear knocked it out of the park including the rest of the cast. Even in the chapters leading up to the end I was assuming they would drop the ball leading into the final chapters as some games do but I was blown away that they where able to take the remaining chapters before the final boss into an emotional roller coaster, and then also to tie up loose ends. This game is simply a love letter to fire emblem fans especially if you missed seeing your boy or girl. Seeing Sigurd made me happy everytime! This game gets a 10/10 from me and a round of applause because I went in with low expectations after playing three snoozes that game made me lose a lot of faith in the series so tbh I went into this one expecting to be disappointed the same way, but came out with a game that I put among some of my favorite fire emblems now."

It got rid of the awful school setting, the overwhelming amount of character relationships, and painful social management system. It’s back to the tried and true classic gameplay tied in with a story that’s relatively straight forward. This game introduces a few new ideas, but none of them are really game changers. The exploration post game adds some unique flavor to this game, but truthfully these types of changes don’t make any difference to me. Regardless, it was miles better than the last game.

Unfortunately the Fire Emblem formula is really starting to feel a bit dated. This gameplay was very fun throughout the 3DS years, but it has not really grown much since then. Each Fire Emblem release is beginning to feel like the same game with a new gimmick and new story. It no longer has the allure that it used to have. I enjoyed this game for about 10 hours, but then I hit a wall where I realized that the series needs something because it’s no longer pulling me in like it did before. Great game, but you have seen it all before."

  ",9,"I'm only writing this as a long time FE fan to counterbalance the negative reviews. I hit 24 hours played earlier today. Overworld map: is basically Awakening/Sacred Stones, so in my opinion one of the best overworld map styles in the series where you have an actual idea of where every battle was.
Paralogues: Divine Paralogues seem to replicate specific maps, the Tiki one apparently recreates a New Mystery of the Emblem map. Normal Paralogues... one gets you Anna, the other gets you the ""Donny/Trainee/Midori/Cyril"" character, like Cyril it's a personal skill and starts out in the healer class. The remaining paralogues unlock level 20 with the Ring Spirits.

Some more details on Paralogues:
Lucina's Paralogue recreates Two Falchions, yep, even Arena Ferox.
So any Ring (not bracelet) recreates a map that the person would be associated with, so Lyn gets a paralogue celebrating the Saccae Plains, Byleth the Sacred Tomb, etc, etc.

I think the characters are colorful if not easily mistaken for someone out of Genshin Impact, so, is that bad? Depends on taste, I've been playing since the GBA, I don't mind it, each game has been evolving the character models and formula with each entry, this is just a 3 Houses style evolution, which was an evolution on the game before, etc, etc. They wanted this artstyle and honestly, it mostly reminds me of FEH the most, of course that's skimming over map part, but the symbols are similar and much like FEH it is a celebration of all things Fire Emblem from Marth all the way to Byleth. Excellent game, definitely worth playing imho, but just be aware that the game is bright and colorful compared to even 3 Houses/Hopes and most titles before. But this did dethrone Pokémon in Japan... so um, game's good, just give it a chance."

I totally understand some players prefer Fire Emblem Three Houses since its plot and the characters are not that attractive, but again, in terms of a strategy game, it's even much better than Three Houses. It is more balanced, meaning you should not let all your male/female characters go for some overpowered jobs/classes. It limits your chance to gain exp at the hardest difficulty so every kill matters. In addition, it enables you to skip mini-games if you just want to focus on the battle."

  ",10,"The game is divisive. That's because it's definitely a quality product, but the direction they took it in is a harsh step in the opposite direction of one of the most popular entries in the series. The story is more simple and juvenile,  and if you're a huge fan of the morally ambiguous nature of 3H, then you will likely not find what you are looking for here. It's a very vanilla experience that honestly feels as though it were written for kids. Considering it's age rating and artstyle, it's entirely possible it actually WAS written for kids. The ending even attempts to impart some very shonen-anime-esque moral lessons on the player.

Regardless, the division is a result of the conflicting priorities of this franchises' playerbase. The music is still top notch, the maps have some of the best designs this series has seen since Conquest, the rings are loads of fun to plan around, the supports are as good as they've always been, and I never want to see an FE game without the break system ever again; it's that good.

You'd think people would respect that Intsys isn't content to rest on their laurals and are willing to take risks. The games are iterative, but compared to other franchises FE places a higher value on novelty. Just looking back in the last 6-7 entries in this 17 game long franchise you can already see a wide variety of artstyles, the combat systems shifting in radical ways,    and a variety of musical styles tailored to the series' many settings. Maybe they have more similarities than difference overall, but again, compared to other franchises, FE does a lot more. Hell, Three Houses was a result this series' commitment to reinventing itself.

Regardless of what I prefer, I fully expect the next entry to resemble 3H more than it does Engage, and when that happens I'll probably modestly enjoy it and give it a 7-8 or something; as opposed to slapping a 0 on it and complaining about the balance or something."

The engage mechanic works really well and keeps combat interesting. But the story and characters are just not up to those of three houses, or even the old-school fire emblem game. It's not fates level bad, but the story never grabbed me and I never felt incentivized to max out the character's supports, as they were almost all lackluster and light on any meaningful dynamics. I was disappointed when I reached the end of the game and found out that they also didn't bother putting in paired endings for other characters,. The lack of a NG+ mode on launch is also disappointing, even if it is nice maddening difficulty is available day 1. Additionally, due to the non-branching story, it's much less replayable than three houses or fates. Overall, a great game if you're looking for a tactical RPG, but those seeking out a solid story and characters are better off going with the recently ported to switch (and much cheaper) persona titles."

There is a difference between a well constructed and fair opinion and slandering a game they probably didn’t even play yet lmao.

Anyways, I will make a quick review about this game and give it a 10 because I’ve never had as much fun in a Fire Emblem game before than this one. The gameplay is absolute perfection and the engage mechanics, the skill inheritance offers an infinite amount of optimisation and strategy to build your team! In other words we are back to the cores of FE’s gameplay where 3H basically threw all of it away and had the most soulless and least FE gameplay (and story) out of them all.

The OSTs are GODLY! Lots of them really caught me off guard and I was really happy about it!

The Somniel is an upgrade compared to the Monastery. Upgrade would a be a very undervaluing how much better it is. Colorful, extremely lively (the more you recruit units) and the mini games are insanely fun and don’t feel like a chores. The Monastery felt like a chore and a very very annoying and quickly repetitive one. Here, you are absolutely free to do all the activities and progress the story whenever! Also you have Sommie, the cutest doggo as a pet which you can caress and play with (That alone should be enough to give this game a 10).

The characters are pretty special. . . They’re so goofy in the best possible way, I literally keep loving them more and more. Alear the protagonist might be one of FE’s the greatest and both the male and female VA fantastically nailed them. All the other characters were nailed! A big congratulations to them! The supports are for the most part short but still very enjoyable. Pretty light hearted and some of them give the characters some depth without overly doing it.

The story now. I suppose that’s what many people are wondering. I’ll be honest, it’s good.
The cutscenes are fantastically well done and let’s not talk about the HD ones. The story itself was extremely well executed. It’s a simple and very classic story. You’ll get a bunch of older FE games from it. The first nine chapters is pretty slow but introduces very well the characters in the goofiest (in a good way) and funniest way possible for most of them. As I said, very classic FE story that is very well executed specifically in the later chapters that will continuously hook you in more and more.
Whoever compared this story with Fates is just lying so hard. For a game that is meant to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Fire Emblem, let me tell you that it perfectly succeeded as what it was meant to be. The way the story was handled with it’s fantastic cutscenes can only mean the best for the future of Fire Emblem. I can’t imagine how good the remakes would look good like this.

10/10

Side note : Whoever is whining about Alear being constantly referred as ""Divine Dragon"" this argument is beyond invalid and stupid. Y’all know it’s because the characters can’t say the MC’s name since it’s customisable. The same way Byleth is called by every single person ""Professor"". Other modern FE games didn’t have that because they weren’t fully voiced lmao."

The characters in FE Engage that I have met so far are fun, the battles are stellar, and the whole game reminds me of earlier FE games before the social simulator was added to Three Houses. The game looks great, although some of the color choices are a bit suspect (I am not a fan of the super bright and colorful main character design, for example). The story is so so and I would like to see a bit more I. The way if building relationships with characters, but not to the extent of the ss hool simulator we got in Three Houses. Overall, this is a great entry into the FE franchise that hardens back to pre Three Houses installments and is worth the asking price based on the great combat alone."

  ",9,"Excellent Fire Emblem game. It's one that was definitely made for the fans. The art style may put some people off which is understandable. But saying it's a ""bad"" game because of character development are clearly people who have never played an entry before awakening. Just because it doesn't have romance building and a less developed support building in no way make it a worse game. The tactical gameplay which is what really matters is solid. It's most definitely an entry which has been made for the fans.

The new break system can really start up a great strategy and clerics are now more viable, instead of just healing they can be effective against spell users, archers and thief classes.

If you are a true fan of fire emblem from entries before awakening, then this game will appeal to you. Especially with the return of characters from previous entries in the form of 'emblems'."

Graphics have been improved quite a bit as well; the general quality of the models and maps is very high, however, the design direction sometimes feel a bit too clean and sanitized, making the world feel too plastic and artificial at times.
The real problem and why this game utterly fails is the story. The plot feels like it was generated by AI with the most predictable twists and most soulless characters. Even though the gameplay was fun, the poor quality of the story keeps stopping me from actually wanting to play it. And that really ****.

Fire Emblem has always been about the perfect ratio **** story and good combat, in Engage it feels like half of it is missing."

-Gameplay is as solid as it’s ever been; happy to see the return of the weapon triangle. From a purely tactical perspective, the engage mechanic adds a nice layer of strategy to the battles.

The Bad:
-The characters are *incredibly* bland, generic, and flat out forgettable. Support conversations are either so short or so shallow that even those don’t help flesh the characters out.
-The voice acting, while not necessarily bad, is noticeably lower quality compared to Three Houses and Echoes.
-The cutesy, ultra-anime style is just not my thing. Hard to take the characters and the world seriously when all the females look like 12 year-old vtubers. You can especially notice it with the emblem characters. Their faces look so child-like compared to their original designs.
-The plot is basic to the nth degree. Honestly don’t think they could have come up with a more dull, hackneyed, and uninspired story if they tried.
-The music is okay, but not up to the Fire Emblem standard."

  ",5,"Fire Emblem Engage is an embarrassment to the franchise.
It's not a 0/10 but it's definitely no higher than a 7 purely based on what it represents for the series. In the pre-Awakening games FE settings and stories took themselves seriously and were played straight. Starting with Awakening this changed to childish tongue-in-cheek self-parodying. Fates and Awakening were games for young children, with embarrassing, cringeworthy writing and dialogue and half assed generic plots. This likely stems from the fact that they no longer have the writing talent they once had. You're not going to squeeze a Genealogy of Radiant Dawn out of the current writers.
However, Three Houses, the previous entry, attempted to recapture the magic of the older games by telling a serious, complex story that took itself seriously tonally and didn't cowardly retreat into self-satire to deflect from its deficiencies. Three Houses was not a perfect game, but it was a step in the right direction to restore some amount of dignity to the franchise.

With Engage, we now have all of that getting thrown into the trash in favour of a retreat into the shallowness and obnoxious tone of the Fateswakening era of games. The lead scenario writer, Nami Komuro, was even the main scenario writer for Fates and Awakening! Why did they bring back a writer who was universally panned? Who knows. Again, perhaps it was because they simply lack the talent that they used to have?
I'm not surprised that Engage has received an immense amount of backlash for its tone and style. When people say ""return to form"", they really mean ""return to Fateswakening"", but the fanbase has moved on since then. People who once assumed FE was always childish and camp realised they were wrong when 3H attempted to tell a serious story. Expectations have been raised, people don't want a Saturday morning cartoon format anymore, they want real stories to get them invested in real characters.
If this game came out in 2014, I'm sure people would have been fine with it. But it's not 2014 anymore, and people expect more from their FE games outside of their gameplay. The shallow cope perpetuated by people who had only played Fates and Awakening that ""FE stories were always bad"" has been thoroughly debunked and nobody is falling for it anymore. They can be good, it's just that the modern developers are lazy.

The gameplay mechanics are alright. Not good enough to make up for how the game fails in every other area. It could have the best gameplay in the franchise and it would still feel like a slog due to how childish and boring every other aspect is. It's also ironic that this is a series defined by perma death and making you feel an attachment to the units, when the average player wants to see every character from Fates, Awakening and Engage killed off for being a constant irritating presence.

It's honestly quite sickening to see these shallow and obnoxious characters dragging around the ghosts of old FE characters, attempting to beat nostalgia into the audience. All they do is serve as a reminder of how good Fire Emblem once was, and how good it could still be, if anybody currently working at Intelligent Systems cared as much about the history of the franchise as the random people they hired from Koei Tecmo for Three Houses. Sad."

  ",10,"The insane review bombing force me to give this game a 10 to offset the high number of 0 it received. A lot of these ""0"" reviewers didn't actually play the game and are either from weirdos who wanted the main character (who's 17-18) to romance a 11 years old girl, or from people who despise everything that isn't a dating sim. This game isn't a 0, people! To everyone reading this in order to make a purchase decision : please read the more nuanced reviews (5-8 out of 10) and totally ignore the 0.

Almost no game deserves a 0, and almost none deserve a 10. This game deserves neither and I would honestly give a 8 for effort as it's kind of a two steps forward, one backward game that didn't manage to check every box it should have.

If anything, it's a return to form to the earlier titles in the franchise more than a spiritual sequel to Three Houses. Those who were introduced to the series with Three Houses may find this a bit difficult to swallow, and I totally understand.

Pros :
1) The animation quality (both cutscene and during combat) is MILES ahead of what Three Houses was. There is simply no comparison there. Every character felt stiff in Three Houses during cutscenes. They're more alive this time and can jump, move around and interact with stuff.
2) Graphics are better too, if it's of any use.
3) Combat system is snappy (for a strategic RPG, that is) and while they dumbed down on some systems, some others are back and the Engage mechanic offset the lack of battalion and gambits.
4) Faster paced. Say what you will, but the whole school phase from Three Houses was kind of a pain on multiple playthrough, and you sometimes forced yourself to go faster just so that you could proceed to the next battle. This isn't an issue with Engage as there is no school.
5) The game is more approcheable by newcomers. Less systems means that they don't have to understand everything to play the game.

Cons :
1) The battles lack scale. In Three Houses, battalions helped give the battle a sense of epic proportion with soldiers running and fighting around. In Engage, your characters are fighting alone against one or two opponents. It feels like a 10v10 fight more often than not.
2) Romance options are really limited, mainly due to localization. This doesn't deserve the actual review bombing, but in the English version of Engage, you cannot romance characters that are of similar age to your main character (17-18), which means that half of the cast is out of ""reach"". But you can romance a 45 years old, go figure.
3) The story is it's weak point : After a relatively original story like Three Houses with four story routes (even if two of them felt quite unfinished), Engage's story is very weak, both in scale and in effort. It's like your typical pre-teen cartoon story of good versus evil than a 10 years old could have come up with. It's highly predictable and it feels like it was written for pre-teen or teenagers at most. It's really no big deal in the grand scheme of thing, but it's a negative nonetheless.
4) This follows number 3. As the story is weaker, the characters aren't as fleshed out and it's likely that you won't like the cast as much as Three Houses' characters, for example.
5) While voice acting is on point (both English and Japanese), dialogue is kind of dumb and cringy. Evil characters say evil things and good characters say good things. There is no nuance, and character depth is severely impaired that way. Everything feels unidimensional.
6) Social aspect is very limited compared to Three Houses.
7) Menus feel a bit weird. There are a lot of submenus or location dependant actions that should have been implemented better.

So, all and all, if the only thing you liked about Three Houses is the story, then skip this game as you'll be really disappointed. Now, I only wish they could get away from the typical anime tropes and create a mature game with mostly adult characters : This way, no one would cry about romance or lack thereoff."

It feels very infantile and regressive, highlighted by some moments reminiscent of past FE glories which are unfortunately few and far between. Cutscenes and dialogues look and sound like a high school theater rehearsal and are painful to watch at times. I really dislike the repetitive nature of the personalities as well. Also, if we get a penny for every dang time ""Divine"" or ""Divine Dragon"" is mentioned or used, we'd all be the next Bezos or Musk, I swear.

I spent hundreds of hours in Three Houses and Three Hopes, enjoying every single moment of it, and I can sense emotional attachment to even the minor characters (Gatekeeper and monastery animals, anyone?). In Engage, I just couldn't wait for things to end, and I can't be bothered developing any attachment to any of these characters.

  ",8,"The biggest problem with Fire Emblem Engage is that it came after Three Houses.

Overall the game is enjoyable, fun and is what I'd expect from a FE title.

However, it is weak in several aspects.

First, and probably the most obvious to anyone who played 3H and Awakening before it, its story. Fire Emblem Engage story is pretty much cliché and totally linear. One of the points that attracted us players to 3H was its story and the ability to decide pretty much what country would rule the world. But I don't think that anyone praising 3H's whole story comparing to Engage remember that the first part of 3H is boring and pretty much the same exact thing regardless of which house you picked, it became interesting after the time lap.

Now, the gameplay. Fire Emblem Engage's gameplay is a big step forward and is very fun and user friendly. A clear improvement from 3H's gameplay which was already good.

Now, I see a lot of people complaining about the lack of ''character development''. When did Fire Emblem Awakening had any kind of character development, except for the main characters? 3H was the only exception to this rule, and yet again, it was for the 4 main characters. Alear  does have some nice character development. You see him/her change, make more rational decisions and surpassing his/her worries and fears.

Like I said, this game had the unfortunate fate of coming out after the masterpiece that as 3H and it made you all set your expectations way too high."

I also feel like half of the time playing, you’re just waiting for the next scene to load. Do not recommend at all."

  ",9,"Fantastic map design, great combat, memorable and fun characters, a campy, informal and yet fun plot, along with a trimming of the unnecessary fluff that Three Houses brought makes Engage a great game and an even better Fire Emblem game. For the Three Houses fans- I suggest giving this game a try before writing it off as a skip- A lot of the appeal to Fire Emblem is the wonderful SRPG gameplay, which this game delivers in spades.
The Class system is no longer ""Make everyone a Wyvern Lord or Dark Flier"", but rather encourages diversity in your team with the passive abilities attributed to units of different Class Types. A healthy mix of powerful combat units and useful utility units is the key to success on the game's hardest difficulty, Maddening.
Map design is a return to form for the series, giving us fun and engaging maps that really test the player's problem solving abilities, especially on Maddening, while also removing or toning down gimmicks like Ambush reinforcements and enemy skills. Gone are the open field, deathball-able maps from games like Awakening and Three Houses, and instead are the fun and tight map design sensibilities from games like Thracia 776 and Binding Blade, offering different side objectives to the player to promote splitting the ever-invincible deathball. Making good use of staves like Obstruct, Freeze, and Warp can be the difference between letting a house be ransacked or receiving a quality reward that makes life easier.
Most of the fluff removed from Three Houses is simply just removing important gameplay aspects from what should've been completely optional minigames. Now, in Engage, you can opt to spend all of 3 minutes in the Somniel forging your weapons and inheriting skills before moving on to the next chapter of the game and keeping that ball rolling. But for those players who need more downtime between the challenging and engaging battles, places like My Room, the Cafe, and minigames like working out and fishing are all available for one to enjoy.
The story is campy and fun, taking the colourful cast of characters around the continent solving problems and escaping trouble all while on the tried-and-true Hero's Journey to collect the rings and defeat the Fell Dragon. With how campy the tone can get, one can only see the lighthearted story as something endearing and enjoyable, while also being a nice break from the heavy political intrigue, angst, and world-building of the previous entry."

  ",5,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses is one of my favorite games on the Switch and probably my favorite FE game. I even really enjoyed the Dynasty Warriors spin off game that came from it while not really being a big DW fan. So, coming into this, I had some pretty high expectations. And, while the gameplay has taken some pretty good steps forward, the story and characters absolutely kill any interest I have in continue playing it.
Starting with the gameplay, the biggest addition are the Emblem Rings. Major upgrades for characters that have the ""soul"" of most of the previous FE games protagonists in them, even from games that have never seen a western release. They offer a ton of options for characters to upgrade their abilities and become a huge powerhouse on battlefield, even if it's not till right before the end of the game do you have the full compliment of rings at your disposal. There's also a new break mechanic that lets you, or your opponent, smash the current weapon they're holding so they can't retaliate for a little bit. And healers can now be used as offensive units as they're now all martial artists, allowing them to smash the bow, tome, and dagger weapons instead of just standing back and healing all the time. There's definitely enough here to definitively say that the gameplay has taken a step forward and, because all characters now move much more fluidly on the battlefield, things are much smoother then they ever have been before and that's very nice.
However it's the story and characters where the game is truly let down. The story is an extremely generic ""kill the evil dragon"" fantasy type story, which is a huge downgrade from the political and religious intrigue from the previous game. Each character is either good just because or evil just because and it became extremely boring when I had to sit through an almost endless amount chapters that never went anywhere except to introduce yet another trope-filled character that had zero personality other then what it's trope said it had to be.  There are way too many characters here, so many that it will be virtually impossible to level more then your standard 8-10 characters on a playthrough. But the biggest let down in the main character, Alaer. Even though they are a literal God in this universe, and are treated as such by each character who interacts with them, even the bad guys, they are about as boring and pathetic as possible. Giving them a voice might have backfired cause they were just so annoying the entire game. I played as the male character so it might be different with the female character, but I absolutely despise them.
I was let down by this game. While I really like the gameplay, and that's the only reason I'm giving this game the score I am, the story and characters attached to it are just so bad it's beyond saving. There's no reason to replay this game after completing the main story and, even with an expansion pass, I can't see myself ever coming back to this game. This is such a setback for the Fire Emblem franchise. While I don't see it being the last one, this one left such a bad taste in my mouth that I don't know if I'll be coming back to it."

LO BUENO
- La música del juego es increíble.
- La guarida que se va ampliando de forma orgánica tras cada capitulo o extra.
- El diseño grafico que le saca la potencia a la consola.
- El sistema de Engage o anillos que aporta versatilidad.
- La traducción en español no presenta modismos.
- Las animaciones de batalla y los diversos escenarios de combate.
- El sistema de combate que mejora el movimiento y se siente mas dinámico.
- No presenta tantos problemas técnicos.
- Si tienes los amiibos es la oportunidad de darles un uso y su recompensa vale la pena.
- Logra un equilibrio justo entre novela visual ""simplificada"" y juego estrategia.
- Misiones extras y con buena dificultad.
- El tablón de donaciones y sus recompensas.
- La torre de los retos que es un modo seudo online bien decente.

LO MALO
- Su historia es bastante Meh! y si lo comparamos con sus entregas clásicas queda debiendo.
- Se simplifico de sobremanera el sistema de relaciones.
- El sistema de romances poco trabajado. Si lo comparamos con Awakening o incluso Fates que aportaban al desarrollo de la trama.
- El protagonista a veces entra en su modo emo y cuesta tomarle algo de seriedad a lo historia.
- Somniel esta desaprovechada, con personajes NPC estáticos y con 4 poses básicas: Mirada muerta, nadando, sentado y ejercicio. El único que se mueve es Somnie que aporta algo de vida a la base.
- Personajes poco carismáticos, si lo comparamos con Three Houses que es su entrega mas cercana.
- El diseño del protagonista que parece sacado de algún juego fandom de juego móvil.
- Que el primer DLC de pago este disponible día 1. No costaba, dar la opción de importar partida guardada de Three House para desbloquear a Claude y otros.
-  Algunas escenas de relaciones que dan cringe. Del estilo poder de la amistad o pasado trágico no tan trágico XD.
- Es bastante fácil crear un personaje roto que rompa el juego. ( Trata de variar el uso de anillos a máximo relacion 5 sino el juego es un paseo hasta en difícil.)
- La granja esta desaprovechada y no justifica su existencia.
- Si vienes de la saga clásica, los modelados de los personajes te decepcionaran un poco. Parecen sacados del Genshin o de una biblioteca de Vtuber.
- Uno que otro mini juego que no aporta mucho y le quita la inmersión.

En conclusión, el juego cumple pese a dar la sensación de parecer una entrega menor de la franquicia. Muy a pesar de lo soso de su historia, personajes planos y momentos de vergüenza ajena. El juego se compensa bien por su apartado jugable, animaciones y un rendimiento notable en la consola.

En fin, debes darle una oportunidad si te gustan los Rpg Tácticos y si quieres que valga la pena juégalo en difícil."

  ",5,"Graphically this game is superior than Three Houses. That's really obvious but there is still a lack of Fire Emblems essence. This game lacks of many spells seen in other games. I think Radiant Dawn is really spectacular visually speaking. Compared to 3H, Engage look much better. But 3H was superior in other areas. Each character had unique critical hits. Or at least they vary from one character to another in the same class. On Engage there is also a lack of weapons. For example, there are many fewer tomes than 3H. They look much better on Engage but they have almost dismantled the game from mages! Another step backwards has been the critical hits animations. In older FE characters used to spin their weapon, specially bow users. They don't do it anymore which is a turn down considering the potential of bow classes in this game.
Finally I would say this feature of fusing with an old emblem doesn't look cool at all. It doesn't feel like a Fire Emblem game. They should be self-sufficient. Why Intelligent System didn't focus more on developing new characters and animations instead of recurring to past ones? I still hope many of this issues will be addressed in the upcoming DLCs"

In terms of game system, it loses the degree of freedom and plot depth in the previous game, but it does not completely delete these contents. Instead, there is a semi-finished character plot and main **** the same time, item collection is also annoying, you have to go to every corner of the map, after every battle!
What is commendable is the combat system, adding the weapon restraint system, canceling the durability of weapons and so on. This is at least a good sign: players said the previous game's training system was too boring, so they simplified it; weapon durability was bad, so they removed it. I think the production team is at least listening to the players, which is why I gave it a 5.
I think this one just serves players who are familiar with Fire Emblem from the previous titles, it shows the main characters from previous generations, maps and music from previous generations, and maybe they will reset the previous titles afterwards.

The story isn’t as good as 3H and the characters aren’t as memorable, but aside from these differences it has made some welcome changes over 3H. The tactical combat is some of the best in the series, period, and I love the art style and relaxing vibe of the Somniel. The UI is also much better and it feels way more streamlined to navigate.

The emblems are also a cool addition, and the AI itself is much better in Engage making it more fun to try out different emblem combinations.

I think in many respects this game is better than 3H, so giving it anything less than an 8 seems unjustified. Still I feel like 3H did such an incredible job with the characters, voice acting, and story, that this game just feels like it’s missing something by comparison. There are a few minor changes that do annoy me in this game. There are a lot of random lines that aren’t voice acted which seems like a strange choice after 3H voice acted nearly everything. I also felt like the tutorial/get to know the game on the beginning was too long, but these are minor gripes.

Overall Engage is an excellent game that doesn’t quite have the same heart as 3 Houses, but definitely makes up for it with a beautiful art style and tight controls. 8/10"

Here are my 2 main issues.
Story: Unfortunately, they put their guards down too much on the story. It feels like they cropped part of previous games and pasted it there. Too much contrast to 3H for sure. While 3H story was heavy, in here it went like ashes. Also too much cringe on their comedy and action. They looked like a group of medieval power rangers in action. Shonen cliched into isekai.

Characters: Honestly, I thought I was watching a circus parade. I do know Mika Pikazo is a great artist with amazing quality. However, she is specialized on illustrating things with strong characteristic traits (ex. vtubers). Almost 90% of the characters in the game were designed with vast clothing in overly saturated colors, and all stood out against each other. Definitely, not a unified design. Plus, her style diminished the maturity on all physical traits. Most looked underaged compared to the previous characters. None of them looked intimidating, even the villains.

New combat system was fun, animation quality was amazing, but if the story and setting doesn't support that... welp it's not a good JRPG to begin with. Now time to apologize to Fates."

  ",9,"Fire Emblem Engage is a colorful, fun, and beautiful game. There are so many characters to deploy and interact with, plus the Emblem Heroes bring a unique and strategic flair to each battle. I'm constantly swapping units and Emblems to maximize my armies battle capabilities and obtain victory on every map. Engage offers tons of replayability with a long campaign, random skirmishes, online play, different characters to strategize with, and player made challenge maps to overcome. I'm glad the focus is back on the gameplay, and while there are less social options than Three Houses, I'm also enjoying the interactions you can have with your army and I'm interested and eager to have another interaction with the colorful and diverse cast of characters. Engage has a unique visual style that often makes it feel like a full blown anime; it might also be one of the best looking Nintendo Switch games that I've ever played! I haven't had any bugs or crashes in over 12 hours of play, and it runs smoothly in handheld and docked on my OLED Nintendo Switch. All in all, this is a game that's going to keep me ""engaged"" for some time to come."

Also it has a major flaw in that the units are badly balanced and tend to be either amazing or immediately benched, if you get any satisfaction from raising your units up this is not the Fire Emblem game for you.
It's just a thoroughly boring experience that tries to posit itself as the new mainline entry whilst giving you nothing but shallow garbage and leaning on nostalgia for older, better games as a crutch.
They should take the Break mechanic and put it into a real FE game, because this half-assed garbage is going to be forgotten in a month. Engage is going the same way as Fates where people are blinded during the honeymoon period and then realise shortly afterwards that the game was thoroughly disappointing. Intelligent System seriously need to get their act together and show that 3H wasn't an outlier and that they can make Fire Emblem games that take themselves seriously and stand on their own merits rather than leaning on self-references and parodying itself.

You're better off buying Conquest, 3H, the GBA era or the Tellius games.
The one thing Engage does right is shoving old characters in your face and reminding you that there are better Fire Emblem games you could be playing."

FE games have always been about the gameplay and engage is definitely moving in the right direction.

The story is criticized for being bland and boring but I enjoyed it and had a great time. Gameplay 10/10 flashy! And combat looks great, the environment can also be destroyed. It’s not for everyone, I don’t get the hate for this game and it seems unfair for it being called a anime game. It’s refreshing and yes the story is predictable but that shouldn’t hinder the fun. I hated how the characters looked like genshin but they grew on me, and the voice actors did an amazing job. Again it’s not for everyone so I recommend you try it, I don’t regret my time with it, and don’t trust what people say as they just bash it for the “weebo characters and cringe story.”"

  ",9,"I have finished about half the game and I'm really annoyed at some of the reviews because Engage game is oozing with quality and polish. I think these reviews were unfair, placing expectations onto a game unfairly and not giving credit to many of the great things Engage does.

The combat just feels so amazing. This is probably the best combat in Fire Emblem. The enemy phase is so snappy and fluid - I really like how it's presented. It really does ooze with polish and I can tell they spent a lot of time rethinking things to make getting information easier. The UI is fantastic! I really love it so far.

The map design and enemy placement is also extremely well done. You can tell the people designing the levels understood Fire Emblem well. They are a pleasure to play through.

I really like the class design in Engage - each unit type is unique and has real pros/cons. A lot of units like thieves, armors and archers all seem like they got a bit of a buff in Engage - armors especially.

One change I noticed almost immediately was something no review even bothered to mention - moving the character around gives battle forecasts by just putting your character near them. I know this is a small change, but it makes sense and it's better than the past games.

I was not sure about the art style and samey faces, but I gotta admit it looks pretty great on a 4k television - the sharpness and color really pops. I actually like the art style for the most part, apart from the sillier outfits (Hortensia is an example of a pretty awful outfit, but that's just me I guess).

I was worried about spending a ton of time on exploring maps after a battle looking for items and stuff, but once I realized there was a mini-map that indicated where everything is, I realized the developers really wanted to respect your time in these sections so you could do them quickly. Also, all the Bond Fragments are automatically collected if you don't talk to people, which really helps with replayability to get through these sections faster. Again, no review mentioned any of this, and it was a concern of mine going into Engage. The developers handled it correctly.

The difficulty on Hard seems stiff but fair and feels really good. I definitely fear losing units and must position them correctly to make sure units don't die. Engage feels a bit harder than Three Houses did - more in line with Conquest or Radiant Dawn on Hard.

And while I don't think I will ever like the avatar character in these games, I actually don't mind this one that much. At least Alear is not a Mary Sue/Gary Stu, although the avatar worship is still a bit cringy. The twins are kind of annoying and there are a couple of other annoying characters, but there are many characters that are likable too.

Also the combat animations finally remind me of the gba games. They are probably the best in any Fire Emblem game, which says a lot because it took them awhile to create stellar animations in most of the 3D entries.

The technicals in Engage are fantastic too. The frame rates just feel so much better than Three Houses all around, especially in the Somniel or exploring the maps after battles. The game runs really well on Switch.

I really like how the Somniel is very optional. Much of the stuff on the ground is for food items and extra Bond Fragment, but none of it seems necessary and you'll be rolling in Bond Fragments by just playing through the game anyway. The mini-games and social activities also aren't that impactful to the long-term, so I feel it's okay to skip them. This is a huge upgrade from the Monastery, which outstayed its welcome in Three Houses when you replayed the game through all 4 routes. The monastery was very tedious, repetitive and took up a lot of time over a 40-50 hour playthrough. The worst part about the Monastery was that it was not optional and took so much time to optimize. The Somniel is nothing like that.

I think the one thing I miss from Three Houses and the Tellius games is the deep world building that could immerse you into the game's world - it's not really there. The Story is also pretty familiar too - likely intentional. It's good enough just to get you from map to map and does the job. It's fine.

Overall, I'm really impressed. This is a really fantastic Fire Emblem game and one that I will be coming back to multiple times after I beat it."

  ",6,"When viewed in the context of the entire franchise, Engage is a disappointment that represents a regression rather than a progression in quality.

Whilst containing an admittedly interesting new battle system, it fails to reach the heights of games like Thracia and Conquest and will seem utterly unremarkable to long-time fans. Furthermore, whatever pleasure is granted by the battle mechanics fails to compensate for the lacklustre nature of the game in all other areas. Alear wanders through a generic world of forgettable characters trying to obtain macguffins whilst nothing interesting or of note occurs. It is a plot and world so generic and formulaic that one wonders if they fed the previous scripts into an AI and generated it mechanically. Plot beats range from mind-numbingly bland to hilariously overdramatic and forced: Engage is a game that seems to want emotional pay-off whilst giving you no reason to care for the characters it establishes.
Characters are regression to the shallow tropes of Fates which feel poorly thought out and like there was no underlying intention to them other than to pad out the roster. Beyond some exceptions such as Diamant, they range from non-entities to Jar Jar Binks level irritating presences that have one personality trait and will repeat it for hundreds of lines of dialogue. The music is serviceable but the most generic of the post-Awakening Fire Emblem games. Character design is awful; it is ironic that despite being so flashy and outrageous, none of these characters will stick in the player's mind once they go off-screen.

It would be interesting to see the break and emblem mechanics in a game that knew what its identity was.
There is no artistic vision or cohesive idea underlying Engage: it is a bundle of elements of poor quality slapped together on top **** system that whilst may be impressive to players whose only prior experience was Three Houses, fails to come even remotely close to being the best of what the franchise has to offer, or to make it worthwhile suffering through the other aspects of the game.
Engage, by all metrics, is at best an average Fire Emblem entry, and at worst a cynical, soulless product with an identity crisis."

Engage addresses this issue while maintaining the mechanic and focusing on the story to provide depth. The interactions unlocked through increasing your relationship with allies seem kinda like filler, at least up until rank B with some characters being more interesting, imo Yunaka mainly. The combat takes the center stage and rightfully so since this is a tactical game, now with optimal RPG elements for my taste at the least. Normal difficulty can be pretty tame, with some battles amping up the difficulty, and Hard just annihilated me, but I preferred playing on Hard for the strategic aspects. Definitely suggest this game if you're a tactical RPG fan and especially if you loved Three Houses but thought you were spending too much time in the HUB."

Lots of good mechanics return from previous games, defence bonuses from forts, weapon triangles and fog of war. This is coupled with new hazard like quicksand and poison traps. This gives a nice spin on the already great tactical combat.

Story:
The only minus of the game. I found the story to be somewhat barebones. You hunt for some rings like a sonic wannabe.
