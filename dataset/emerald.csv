  ",9,"The third generation masterpiece, this game is contender for the best mainline Pokémon game in the entire series. It’s a perfect combination of what came before, with some excellent quality of life additions. Game Freak capitalized on all that made Pokémon special and perfected it with this entry. The Hoenn region is an iconic creation, with rich varying environments and a design which seems to emphasize more natural environments. This detail is definitely relevant to the overall theme of the game and lore of the region. The game does a solid job of leaving you with a memorable experience of an area, Sky Pillar leading to the encounter with the box legendary, Rayquaza being the most notable example. The designs are great, gifting us with fan favourites like Gardevoir and Metagross. The Hoenn starters are some of the best designed starters, competing with other notable starter lineups and the legendary selection, while scarce, is surprisingly potent. Overall Emerald is definitely one of the best offerings Game Freak has ever created, proving that the perfected third edition of the previous dual entries is still the most desired and effective path for the series."

But this one was different enough for me to think that it was a new experience. But I don't think that Wallace was a good champion because his entire team was water type.

  ",8,"gonna leave this as a filler, will edit if i want to do a full review one day. tl;dr is, these games are hoenn. they are amazing in most aspects, although they're pretty devoid of content outside the battle frontier, the battle frontier is filled with mostly bad concepts, some of the good ones have bad execution (battle factory actually punishes you for switch out your mons thanks to a bug that resets IVs when you switch Pokemon). if you don't care about the battle frontier nor like the battle frontier, emerald doesn't have much left to offer in comparison to newer pokemon titles. its postgame content is very overrated. the gen 3 battle mechanics are not great, emerald has a bug that makes soft resetting for shinies more difficult, emerald also doesn't have a great amount of Pokemon relative to its national dex to begin with, as Pokemon wanted to make sure it ALL went spread out across every Gen 3 title, does not have many of the quality of life benefits ORAS has. this game is essentially ruby and sapphire, but messier. it was probably rushed in and made for more profit. main adventure is easily one of the most replayable and rewarding in the series to this day. it's a great game to jump into if you want a quick, fun run through a pokemon adventure. don't expect much more than that though, unless you are willing to endure some of the worst battles you have ever played in your life via the battle frontier. that frontier was for sure quantity/quality and is the most overrated postgame feature in the series, next to Johto having a second region."

  ",8,"Emerald was a game that I played with half a brain when I was little, never understood it, and because it was my first introduction to RPGs, I thought I could overcome everything by leveling up. Although Pokemon actually had a simple rock-paper-scissors system, I couldn't understand this system due to my age and my lack of English, and I started to play the pokemon that I had started, but after a while I failed in long fights and quit the game when I couldn't progress in the game. I didn't even know the mechanics of catching Pokemon. So what kind of game is Emerald when you look at it critically now?

Pokemon games are very sweet games. I don't know if it's its own concept, but having a team of six pokemons at our disposal and pitting these teams against each other with different moves is a nice concept for RPG lovers. The sense of exploration in the game is always very nice. Even if the rewarding is very unbalanced, you want to explore everywhere, because the imbalance in rewarding can lead you to find something very beautiful in a very strange place. Also, it's definitely a nice addition that we can unlock things that are kind of like fast travel with the features where we load pokemons, almost like a metroidvania. These aren't new things, but they're things that are in this game, so I'm evaluating them. The biggest flaw of the game is that I think it's user-hostile. Yes, the game is very sweet, but I'm not sure if we are asked to continue playing or not. I have no idea how we played some of the exploits that we can close in today's emulator conditions. Catching a pokemon consumes a very unnecessary number of pokemon balls, wild encounters that you constantly encounter if you haven't bought a repel and make it even more difficult to walk somewhere. The game is slow in general and the animations are not beautiful enough to make it worth the waste of time. However, in today's conditions, thanks to game acceleration and artificial save points, these points can be covered up and the game can be played much more comfortably. But there is one thing that can't be glossed over, the game is a bit cryptic. Especially when I think that they made the game to appeal to children, the game can get bogged down at some points. So please don't make the same mistake I did and listen to the NPCs even if they speak very slowly because they will probably tell you where to go next. Even if you don't hang out in the main story of the game, why would I go back to the weather station and talk to a specific NPC there after finishing the game to get a legendary pokemon? Should this information be revealed to me?

Pokemon games are sweet games, their visuals and music are sweet too. There is nothing much to say. They even have some music that I think is extra good (Deoxys), but since Nintendo doesn't release it anywhere, it's very difficult to listen to it.

There's a sweet story that the game tries to set up, which is obviously better than the cheesy ""go collect all the pokemon"" story in Red and Blue. Also, I think it's very enjoyable to be able to fight with such big pokémon and then capture them and add them to the team. They even added some sweet side quests to the game.

Emerald is a sweet game. I know I've written this for the hundredth time, but I can't find a better term to describe this game. After FireRed, I'm satiating my Pokemon hunger with this game. Until I get a phone that can emulate the DS comfortably, I'm done."

It also has a crazy fun twist in that you have two evil teams in Magma and Aqua scheming in it. In Ruby, Team Aqua helps you in your fight against Team Magma, and vice versa in Sapphire. Emerald still remains the only Pokemon game with two evil teams scheming in it, and is easily the greatest Gen 3 Pokemon Game by a wide margin."

  ",10,"Having played Pokemon for over two decades I think the franchise's highest peak was in generation 3 and especially with the release of Pokemon Emerald. Gen 3 revolutionized Pokemon with the introduction of EVs, IVs, complex breeding, double battles, and the first and best iteration of the battle frontier to date. The world of Pokemon Emerald is vast, beautiful, and packed full of secretes. The music like always is incredible, the Pokemon designs and concepts are some of the best in the franchise, the post game is expansive, and the story is complete. Pokemon Emerald hits every single mark for a great Pokemon game and is in my opinion, the most complete experience in the history of the franchise. Generation 3 was also the final generation where catching them all was an actual challenge and rewarding goal. Since the introduction of wifi trading in generation 4, the task of catching them all has been trivialized to sitting on a couch throwing up virtual trades over the course of a few weeks with the more current games completely abandoning the concept by excluding significant portions of the Pokemon roster. Playing Pokemon Emerald today is still a ton of fun, but Pokemon is at it's best when there is a larger community to play with which will always be maintained with the most recent games. But, if you were there back in 2005 playing, trading, and battling with friends in person, working together to solve the post game puzzles and mysteries, and trying to catch them all, no experience has since compared to generation 3 and Pokemon Emerald."

no need for fragile online only events and timed event Pokémon that are lost after services for offline or the event cartridges are locked up in the Pokémon vaults forever.

There was a few limited events during the 3rd generation but none felt necessary to seek out, noting made the game feel any less then a complete 16-Bit RPG masterpiece.

Pretty much everything you want in a Pokémon game is here, besides story. And don’t get me wrong Pokémon Emerald version has the best story if you look at it from Gen 1-3 only.
Amazing music

Of course he showed me the game and years later i finally played it but it wasn't that fascinating like the other generations. The map and the story was kinda boring and the only special thing about it were the new Pokemon. Think i made the right decision.

  ",10,"Fun and replayable. With over 200 pokemon to catch you can make many teams and most likely never play all of them.
Double battles are a new addition and add a change from the ""a"" mashing and require a bit of strategy.
After playing awhile I realized that I became attached to my pokemon. And I could relate and really felt bad for them when they fainted. I would always curse out the opposing pokemon and obliterate them mercilessly before I take my poor pokemon to the pokecenter to heal.
The game is challenging if you don't play it right. There is almost required grinding (battling everyone and lots of wild pokemon to raise levels) and nobody to tell you to do it. The first time you play you may want to catch and raise every single pokemon you see, but get around to the second and you may find you want to raise less. Then less. Then only a few. And that's when you will win.
My tips are raising your favorites your first time around, and seeing what you're good at. Then once you actually know what you're doing, raising only a good team that is good against most types.
This is my favorite thing about this game BY FAR though. When you start you have dorky looking creatures like a fish, chicken, or tree frog thingy but by the end you have much more badass looking monsters that destroy everything in 1 hit.
All in all, this game is fun and probably my favorite game of all time ever."

  ",10,"Man, no one on this site can give a good critical review worth a damn...

Eh, I digress, despite this game not being INSANELY popular among game critics or even fans of the series, Pokemon Emerald shines as one of the best quality games in the series. The problem with the Pokemon sister games (E.G. Platinum, Crystal, Black or White 2.) is that critics always review them as stand alone titles when they should really be reviewing them as improvements over the original game's formula, rather than giving them a low score because they didn't innovate enough. Emerald takes Ruby and Sapphire and makes lots of little improvements rather than a few large ones, and lets be honest, as Pokemon fans, that's what we really want.

While it is deceptive, the subtle differences can catch you off guard. For the first time in the series, we have sprite animations on your Pokemon. (Small Improvement but improvement nonetheless.) You have a SIGNIFICANTLY better end game than in Ruby and Sapphire, being able to catch more legendary Pokemon, being able to take on the battle frontier (Which may as well be an entirely new set of gyms.) And several new Pokemon introduced or that were otherwise unavailable in the original games. It adds several new locations and events so there is room for non-linear exploration and fun.

While it's true that the games battle system remained the exact same, Pokemon seems to be the only franchise that gets punched around too much for not innovating. Other RPG series like Final Fantasy or even Legend of Zelda can be a mite repetitive in re-using their formula's, but they get a free pass. And when Pokemon DOES innovate within itself, it goes unnoticed. Even though it's only a small step ut, this is the definitive way to experience the 3rd generation of Pokemon, hands down. If critics expected anything different than a slight improvement from a sister game like Emerald, then clearly they have a misguided notion."

  ",10,"There is something wonderfully magical about that moment when you discover that one of the most enchanting experiences of your childhood is, in fact, also an awesome game of skill. This what the Emerald was for me, a first step into a world of Pokemon battling, a world that is jealously hidden from all but the most dedicated fans. All of this wouldn't be possible if Game Freak didn't step forward with the idea of Battle Frontier. It's basically a place where trainers can test their battling skills in variety of rulesets (7, to be exact). If you succeed, you will earn points for which you can buy prizes that you can use for further improving your team. The best of the best will get to face the Frontier Brains and earn Symbols as a proof of victory. This is quite similar to the badge quest, except much, much more challenging and, consequently, fun. You simply won't succeed if you don't touch upon the complex battle and stat mechanic system of Pokemon games. If you let yourself delve into them, thinking up of effective strategies, carefully training your monsters and testing new teams will soon become your second nature. The rest of the game is mostly the same as (already awesome) Ruby and Sapphire, with a few cosmetic changes like the moving sprites, more focus on Double battles, modified plot and addition of some Johto Pokemon. All in all, Pokemon Emerald is an exceptional addition to the already rich franchise, and is my personal pick for the best video game of all time. Now go dust off your trusty Game Boy Advance and get ready to have 400 hours of your life **** away by pure awesomeness."
