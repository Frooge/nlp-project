The battles are still good fun don't get me wrong, I think the combat\u002Fanimations in this game are a step above and take a lovely turn toward more traditional fire emblem with fun and interesting mechanics, The Emblems are cool, the good kind of implimentation of a \"gimmick\", they also just allow for more depth in unit customization, all that is great.\nBut the story and most noncombat gameplay here is lackluster at best, all the characters are just tropes or caricatures of a better character, flanderized to hell and back. And all the supports are just... they're nothing sandwiches with extra cringe.\nWhat Happened? They try so hard to do kinda what Three Houses was doing but completely miss the mark, and even the point, with a lot of these mechanics. The Somniel wants to be the Monistary so bad but it isn't even CLOSE to being as fleshed out, There's very little to do in comparison except run around talking to boring ass NPC's or pick up trash like a bum, maybe do squats and buy ****, arena fights are a cool addition though. Being able to pick units to fight against one another and gain EXP, that includes Emblems as well. But its so barebones, it has all the heart the Monstary had stripped out and now its just a lame hub world. I stopped watching the supports, they were so, so bad. All of them, and I mean all of them, act like 12 year olds, its so mindnumbing to watch they brainless characters interact. A real **** shame since those used to be one of my favorite parts of Fire Emblem. All in all what do I think?

Engage felt like it failed to convey any real character depth, had an extremely cut and pasted story with inconsistent story beats.\n\nI will admit though, there were some redeemed points in some areas of the combat. Despite it being a modern FE game with easy power leveling, which nullifies the challenge, (if you're looking for that) it delivers some things that are a nice inclusion like the action Break mechanic, and the Engage system. Engages are very busted however, showing a severe lack of balancing of the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a Fire Emblem game, this game may scratch that itch at its bare minimum.

Firstly, while I hate to judge some subjective topics like Character Art and Story. I feel like this element is really dragging the game down, they cannot support gameplay elements at all. While the character design is okay for me, the story is really bland, and repetitive, and reduces the variety of bosses in gameplay. Friendship conversation is also not as well made as Three Houses since it is divided into rings too.\nSecondly, while the core gameplay is great and challenging more than Three Houses, The balance in this game is really bad. This game forces you to bench the old one and use the new unit instead.  While I love variants of classes in this game. Classes are also not balanced. In the end, you must pick only the one that can make it to the endgame.\nFinally, the UX in this game is really bad. You need a lot to traverse through an area to get a little thing done such as obtain skills.

However, it manages to alienate both new fans and long-time ones by barely putting effort into its dialog, story, or characters and just half-assing them to pull in quick cash. The story is a complete mess as it falls over itself to try and give an artificial goal for the players through the deaths of two characters without ever bothering to explore these characters rather than plot devices. The story even breaks its rules twice to bring the protagonist back to life without suffering the consequences of the Corrupted or the Emblems. Then you have the cast that all act like cosplayers in a world at war. Very often, these characters try to sell you on their personality quirks or their likes without exploring why they are like that or what they truly want. While some supports are more serious and take time to flesh some characters out, these are the exceptions and most of the cast feels shallow or overly goofy. Then there is the tonal shift where the story tries to be serious and show a war story without taking the time to explore the conflicts around you and then the supports try to have a goofy tone, causing the game to give players whiplash from the contrasting tones.

My first was Three houses though, which is still to date is my favourite game as I loved the story and the character development. \nNow for Engage… lets start with the good; Game play (as many other people stated before) is one of the best. I don’t care for the emblem rings, it became confusing when more than one unit was engaged on the map and I couldn’t distinguish who was whom, but other than that was ok. Love the return of the weapon triangle and the fact that they removed weapon durability. Art style is nice, but I don’t really care for it either. As long as there is a good and engaging (pun intended) story, they can be stick figures for all I care. That’s where my disappointment with Engage comes into place. The “story” (if I call it that…). It feels like a 5 year old wrote it. I never thought there would be a worse story than Fates but here we are. At least in Fates the support conversations were ok (some even enjoyable). In engage after 40 hours I just skipped them. I benched the first 2 characters from the start (cant remember their names, the twins or something). They were just sooo annoying. I benched them after the 100th time I hear the phrase “Divine dragon”. I just couldn’t take it anymore. I’ve seen that only 1 person wrote the whole story and supports for this game, which is a huuuuge task, but WHY ON EARTH would you give this task to the same person who wrote Fates’ story???? You knew already how poorly that game was received because of it’s story. WHY???\n\nIn every FE game the main thing is permadeath which makes you think twice and it adds to the suspense, but it only adds to the gameplay if you actually care about loosing your units. I didn’t care for them, so if they dies, well tough s****, I just moved on to the next one.  The menus and inventory management are (or at least was, not sure if they patched it) annoying; you need to travel between locations between loading screens just to check what skills a character has, or what you need to get it, then go to another location, duel, get those gems and go back and get the skill.\nMusic in this game also annoyed me. I love the soundtrack in every Fire Emblem I played, but this one I had to mute. Its just my taste though, but I still listen to 3H’s music to this day. I bought the Collectors edition of this game as I do with every FE game (heck I even have all the limited edition stuff from Fates as I liked Conquest’s maps) but I wish I just bought the normal one or didn’t buy it at all.\n\nSo just to summarise;\n\nGOOD\u002FOK\n\nGameplay\n-Art style\n-Weapon Triangle\n-No kids (it was really overwhelming and Pokemon-like collect them all in Fates and Awakening)\n\nMISSING \u002F BAD\n\n-STORY (or the lack of it)\n-Character development\n-Music\n-End-story cards after beating the game like in 3H. I really liked this little touch just to know what happened to the characters (well…. Didn’t really care for these characters, but hope they will bring it back in future entries)\n\nI really hope this is not where the franchise is going with future entries. Hoping the developers can check this site as the scores are not as great as they were\u002Fare with 3H. This game is a HUUUGE step back from Three Houses.

I also must give a shout-out to Intelligent Systems for their awesome music team. They also did music for games like Warriorware. Their chord progression and dreamy orchestral feel for Fire Emblem never ceases to amaze and I must talk about that too. Tithe game’s got something for the casual and hard core vet players as well which makes it a welcome addition to my collection.     The story is great to go along with it to boot. You okay the Divine Dragon in human form of course and you gather your forces together from different kingdoms across the land to prepare for a strategic fight of epic proportions against the Evil Dragon.      Mostly every character you come across in the game you can have on your team. I call this the Goku approach. It gives you something to look forward to, and I can say I like it a lot!      To me the game for multiple reasons is hard to dislike because they stick to the formula and along with that they give you all the older characters via Spirits from the Engage Character Rings. Marth is the first one you start with but it steadily expands to other characters from past FE games.       They even are doing DLC where more characters via rings and bracelets are available as well. You have a home base called Somniel floating in the sky. There is where lots of things go down. You can train characters and teach them new techniques from the rings they have with bond fragment points which are earned in a number of ways.      You can increase bonds with characters by doing all sorts of things together other than battling. You can increase bonds with characters and the engage rings\u002Fbracelets too.      It wouldn’t be Fire Emblem without classic permadeath and it’s there if you want it. It’s so funny if the main character dies he will still be alive for the story but he’s never with you in battle. So technically from a gameplay standpoint even the main character isn’t exempt from permadeath if you so choose that option.       Every character is well written and thought out and the interactions with each other is priceless. It was nice to see character diversity. They do a very good job with that. I dare say that Japan is better at marking dark\u002Fbrown skin characters than most American games and that says a lot.       That’s one of the reasons they will always have my support, plus their games are just so fun! It’s hard to not like them! The music!!!! Oh My God! The music is absolutely banging on this game from the orchestral arrangements to how the best kicks in when things get serious in battle. From your side to the enemies side when it’s their turn to fight.      You can even control what music comes on how often and on which side during combat! I love little things like that! The game overall is incredibly fun and the DLC is very worth it. For me it was the first time for most of these characters.      Sadly the only ones I knew were Marth and Roy way back from Super Smash Bros. Melee. I of course got educated from the amount of other games and lore out there eventually, but I love how the game has these characters in there and shows their significance!     I give Fire Emblem Engage a 10\u002F10! Absolutely amazing and I almost forgot to mention the animations and facial expressions of the characters were amazing and felt so real, you could feel for them and their struggles. I recommend it to anyone and everyone! A must buy for one’s RPG collection!
